-= Explanations =-
- "Ernstes-Gefecht2" is the typical boss battle theme while more special themes are used for specific fights.
- The ambush will have "Bedrohung_von_oben" since it has more suspense than "2003MaximumBattle".
- The battle against Sedric will have "2003MaximumBattle". "warlord" is too serious, "Fremder_Gegner" is for when you're being overpowered, and while "2003MaximumBattle" might not have the best transition, it fits in the context. Incidentally is fitting since this is the last actual boss battle.
