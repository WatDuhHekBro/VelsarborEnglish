The three of them got a peace treaty to be signed. There's a sense of urgency, and they just hope things go right. The twin souls they're watching over are Kento and Genyu. 9 years before the events of Sinkholm, they're talking about Kento as a child, probably during his grief over the loss of his mother, and/or his growing vengeance towards Genyu. In their eyes, he's "trapped" in the clouds of these thoughts of hatred, and that him being "freed" will mean that he comes to terms with his father. They reluctantly hope that fate will work out as Heimdall, I assume another prophet, says. I assume that the event they're trying to prevent is the world devolving into another war, evidenced by the growing tensions between the two nations.

When Kento and Genyu finally meet, rather violently to their shock, they conclude that the string of actions necessary to prevent the world from destroying itself (the second great war) is set in motion. Kento is the one who will change the fate of the world. The "hurdle" is him coming to terms with the fact that his father is alive. They're hoping that Kento makes it through this ordeal (kinda like in CrossCode, omega spoilers).

After the group meets Felcis who plans an escape, they realize that he's being held captive by Sir Dolaros, the general who overpowered even them. It probably wasn't part of their plan for Kento to be captured like this. And if my suspicions are right that those three, Felcis, and Genyu are all working together on this, they probably wanted to hold Kento there until he accepted Genyu being alive. However, Genyu and Felcis decided to get Kento back by sending him to Helnovien, probably not realizing who's in charge. Despite that, they're still going to let fate run its course and only intervene when necessary, but still prepare in the event that Kento does meet Sir Dolaros on his way out.
