**Note** It seems that the game's pretty inconsistent about Birkon/Brigantia and Zojeno/Korzojeno. The beginning of the game and the later parts of the game aren't consistent, even though it's clear that they're the same from context.

The Nation of Brigantia
Brigantine Soldiers
Brigantians live in the world.

The Nation of Korzojeno
Korzojenish Soldiers
The Korzojenish live in the world.

The Continent of Tora
The Great Toran Pass

The Region of Farenia
Farenian Soldiers
Farenians live in the world.

Herr Tirunel: Sir Tirunel
Fräulein Filaja: Dame Filaja

**Note** "Dame" is specifically for addressing knighthood, and also sounds more on par with the level of formality of "Sir". "Madam" just doesn't sound right at all, it's far too formal. Probably because it sounds like something you'd say to an old person, or someone of an affluent rank, like a political one rather than a military one.
