The prophecy draws ever so near...
The stars aligned according to my magnificence...
My utter perfection!

I shall kill you now in order to fulfill that prophecy.
So that I may become immortal!

It's such a shame that your time has come to an end.
It was nice knowing you, but our fates must collide now.

Our destinies were bound to impact, long before either of us were aware of it, as the prophecy foretold.

And thus, I part to you, a gift.
What is that gift, you might ask?

Why, it is the gift of experiencing not just any ordinary death, but a death full of spectacle and splendor!

The gift, of experiencing the ultimate death!

Prepare yourselves, for the greatest death known in existence!!
