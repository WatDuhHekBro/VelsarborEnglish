Saion: You again. We'll see each other again in the tournament, just you wait!
Soko: What's going on between you three? You should really talk about your problems instead of...
Saion: Our problems? Is it any of your business? Worry about your own stuff!
Kento: Come on Soko, better to just leave them alone...
Saion: Pah! The fact that you beat us again means nothing! I demand a rematch!
Jorn: Rule number one of the Zinkar Brothers: We never learn our lesson!
Saion: Jorn, shut your cheeky mouth already!
Saion: Ha! The Zinkar Butchers are making their way through the ranks, it seems. You'll be surprised who ends up getting slaughtered!
Jorn: Your name's on the chopping block!
Saion: Shut up, Jorn!
Saion: Already rank \v[1886], are you? Not long until our fated battle arrives! Oh yeah!
Jorn: What a joy.
Saion: You see that? Even this stubborn redhead of a brother is looking forward to this battle!
Jorn: Stubborn brother? Someone must've stuck a mirror to me somewhere.
Saion: What are you trying to say again?!
Saion: Oh, hello! Here, we have the "Zinkar Butchers"! Pretty bold when choosing a name, I have to say!
Jorn: I already feel like fresh meat to be sliced.
Saion: Quiet, Jorn! It's always you with your pessimistic mood.
Saion: Ha! So? What's your rank right now? We're all waiting very impatiently here for our duel!
Jorn: Are we really doing this?
Saion: We'll prove that we can take on a couple of Brigantian soldiers!
Jorn: Just attack some guards if you want to prove it.
Saion: Be quiet, Jorn!

Jorn: Please just leave me alone, okay?
Jorn: I hope you had fun. You can try your hands at these Pauamainers. They're quite violent though.
Jorn: I know that all too well, as Saion often drags us along to challenge them... And their boss is way beyond our strength anyway...
Saion: This is so typical of you! Always complaining and whining!
Jorn: After half a dozen defeats against these guys, I have every reason to do so!
Jorn: Looks like it'll soon be a "slaughterfest". And here I thought that the only ambitious ones would be this blue-haired disaster of a brother.
Jorn: Just wonderful, you're getting closer and closer to our rank. You're really serious about this, aren't you?
Cibon: Well, come on, it's just a battle in the end. And your brother didn't want it any other way.
Jorn: I know, but I'm getting dragged into this mess. Nobody asks me!
Soko: Trust me, it's not that different on our side.
Cibon: Why, where, what? I never saw you complaining, Soko!
Soko: So what? That doesn't mean I like it.
Jorn: Hey, I think we understand each other then.
Jorn: Come on, Soko, let's make a deal! We'll both just go on strike and do nothing during the battle!
Soko: Sounds interesting.
Cibon: Hey now, don't get any ideas!
Jorn: The Zinkar Butchers... What a great name. Now I won't be able to sleep peacefully during the night.
Saion: You're such a scaredy cat! What do names mean anyway? You can see just how far we've come!
Jorn: What? Fear is such a wonderful thing. It keeps you from doing stupid things.
Jorn: And SOME people around here could really use a little more fear...
Jorn: You really don't have to hurry with this whole tournament nonsense.
Jorn: I'd be really happy if my brother couldn't find an opponent to fight for a day...
Soko: Is it okay if I ask why you're still doing everything your brother forces you to do?
Soko: You two don't seem to agree very often...
Jorn: Well... Um... We're brothers?
Jorn: And it's not like I have people to go to or a place to stay if I were to leave my brothers.
Jorn: Besides, you can't imagine what kind of drama Saion would stir up if that were to happen...
Saion: What are you talking about over there?
Jorn: We're currently discussing whether your actions stem from a lack of intelligence or a mental disorder.
Saion: What the... I do everything we have to do as a gang of thieves!
Jorn: Yeah, I could really discuss this topic for a long time.

Gurim: ...
Gurim: Congratulations on winning.
Cibon: Thanks, you fought well too.
Gurim: We'll see each other in the tournament soon...
Cibon: I'm kinda curious to see if your ability to fight with these strange weapons has improved.
Kento: Speaking of strange weapons, are you still struggling to use that stuffed bag, Jorn?
Jorn: That one? Not anymore! We wouldn't have enough items to fill it until it's strong enough.
Kento: What are you fighting with then?
Jorn: Well... You'll see...
Gurim: Hello...
Soko: You really are a welcome change compared to your talkative brothers.
Gurim: T... Thanks...
