Saion: Hmph! We'll get back our spot on the leaderboard, just you wait!
Jorn: I see many months of cruel battles coming my way. Someone get me out of here, please!
Saion: Jorn, will you please stop whining all the time?
Saion: Gurim and I survived the whole ordeal and we never once complained! So get yourself together!
Jorn: We all know by now that you like getting beaten up and that Gurim never complains at all!
Jorn: Nobody's forcing us to go to all these battles, ever thought of that?
Jorn: Damn, at this point, I'd take working in the mine every day over battling in the tournament even for just one more time!
Saion: I'm doing my best to create a good reputation for us here and move us forward!
Saion: And all you do is whine, whine, whine! You should be GRATEFUL to me for even helping you out at all!
Jorn: GRATEFUL?! YOU'RE the reason we ended up here in the first place! Just because you wanted to get your revenge back then no matter what!
Jorn: And even here, fighting is still the only thing you can think of!
Saion: I've had to keep telling you this so many times already! This type of life is ingrained in our blood! Us Zinkars never miss an opportunity!
Saion: But what am I saying? Of course you don't get any of that! You're the BLACK SHEEP of us three!
Jorn: You're right! I'm the black sheep! AND I'M LUCKY I AM! <#
Jorn: Otherwise I'd have this IDIOT BLOOD in me that'd take away my ABILITY TO THINK and turn me into a COMPLETE MORON! <#
Saion: WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY?! GET BACK HERE RIGHT NOW!!
Cibon: W... What was that just now...
Soko: Gurim... What was Jorn talking about?
Gurim: It's been a while since they last had that bad of an argument...
Gurim: Jorn... is actually just a half brother to us... It's complicated...
Gurim: And Saion's probably gonna keep reminding him of that...
Gurim: Excuse me, but I have to go and make sure the two are alright...
Soko: It seems like there's some underlying problem behind all those arguments...
Kento: It's not up to us to be the psychiatrists here. It's their business and we shouldn't interfere.

Felcis: So my friend, we won, and you know what that means? Hand it over.
Robin: Yeah yeah. Alright. You lucked out this time. Take your damn stone already.
Robin: Next time we meet in the arena, we won't make it so easy for you, mark my words!

Pauamainer Member: Your performance was the best we've seen today! We haven't had such strong opponents in a long time!
Pauamainer Member: Have a look at our base if you've already made it into the underground Pauamainer Brotherhood! We might have something for you.

Saion: You again. We'll see each other again in the tournament, just wait!
Soko: What's going on between you? You should talk about your problems instead of ...
Saion: Our problems? What is it that interests you? Take care of your own stuff!
Kento: Come on Soko, better leave it ...
Saion: Pah! The fact that you hit again means nothing! I demand revenge!
Jorn: Rule number one of the Zinkar brothers: We never learn our lesson!
Saion: Jorn, you kindly keep your cheeky mouth!
Saion: Ha! The Zinkar butchers are progressing, it seems. You will be surprised who slaughters whom!
Jorn: Your name is on the agenda! < Your name's on the chopping block!
Saion: Shut up, Jorn!
Saion: Place \ v [1886] are you already now? Not long now and our fight is imminent! Oh yeah! < Not long until our fated battle arrives!
Jorn: Oh joy.
Saion: Do you see? Even this stubborn redhead from brother is looking forward to this fight!
Jorn: Stubborn brother? Someone must have stuck a mirror to me somewhere.
Saion: What does that mean again ?!
Saion: Oh hello! There are the "Zinkar butchers"! Pretty self-confident when choosing a name, I just say!
Jorn: I already feel like fresh meat. < to be sliced
Saion: Quiet, Jorn! You always with your pessimistic manner.
Saion: Ha! And? What rank do you have now? We are all waiting impatiently for your challenge!
Jorn: Are we doing this?
Saion: We'll prove we can take on brigand order soldiers!
Jorn: You can just attack a couple of guards if you want to prove it.
Saion: Be quiet, Jorn!

Jorn: ... please leave me in peace, yes?
Jorn: I hope you had fun. You can try to fight these Pauamainers. They are really violent.
Jorn: I have to know, as often as Saion has taken on us ... And her boss is beyond our borders anyway ...
Saion: This is so typical of you again! Just howling and whining!
Jorn: After half a dozen defeats against this guy, I have every reason to do so!
Jorn: It looks like it will soon be a "slaughter festival". And I thought that ambition would only have this blue-haired mischief from brother.
Jorn: Well, wonderful, you are getting closer and closer to our place. You really mean it, don't you?
Cibon: Come on, it's just a tournament fight. And your brother didn't want it any other way.
Jorn: Yes, but I'm being dragged into this mess. Nobody asks me!
Soko: Believe me, on our side it's not necessarily that different.
Cibon: How, where, what? You never really complained, Soko!
Soko: So what? That doesn't mean that I like the stuff.
Jorn: Hey, I think we understand each other then.
Jorn: Come on, Soko, we're making a pact! We both will just go on strike and do nothing during the fight!
Soko: Sounds interesting.
Cibon: Now don't get stupid thoughts!
Jorn: Zinkar Butcher ... Very great name choice. Now I can't sleep peacefully during the night.
Saion: You're such a scaredy bunny! What does a name mean? You can see how far we've come!
Jorn: What? Fear is such a wonderful thing. It keeps you from doing stupid things.
Jorn: And some people here could really use a little more fear ...
Jorn: You really don't have to hurry with this tournament story.
Jorn: I'm really happy if my brother can't find an opponent to fight for a day ...
Soko: May I ask why you are doing everything your brother imposes on you?
Soko: You don't seem to agree very often ...
Jorn: Well ... um ... we're brothers?
Jorn: It's not that I know people I could go to when I leave my brothers.
Jorn: Besides, you can't imagine what kind of theater Saion would do in this case ...
Saion: What are you talking about over there?
Jorn: We are currently discussing whether your actions are due to a lack of intelligence or a mental disorder.
Saion: What the ... I act exactly as we have to act as a gang of thieves!
Jorn: Yes, you could really discuss the topic for a long time.

Gurim: ...
Gurim: Congratulations on your victory.
Cibon: Thank you, you fought well too.
Gurim: We'll see you in the tournament ...
Cibon: I'm curious to see if your fighting style has improved with this strange weapon.
Kento: Speaking of weird weapons. Are you still struggling with this filled pouch, Jorn?
Jorn: The one? No way! We wouldn't have enough items to fill it with a solid weight.
Kento: What are you fighting with?
Jorn: Well ... you'll see ...
Gurim: Hello ...
Soko: You are really a welcome change compared to your talkative brothers.
Gurim: D ... thank you ...
