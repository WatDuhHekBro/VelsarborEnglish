Announcer: Our next battle is just around the corner! The first combatant enters the arena!
Announcer: THE ZINKAR BUTCHERS!
Announcer: Oh! This group set a goal for themselves! But this goal is still quite a ways away, and thus, a long journey through the ranks lies ahead of them!
Announcer: Let's hope that their name says it all!
Announcer: Slowly but surely, they're getting closer to their ultimate goal! Will they hold out until the bitter end? And will they really be up to the task to face their archenemies when the time comes?
Cibon: Of course we'll be!
Announcer: They want to see Zinkar blood spilt! Those brothers better be careful! Their archenemies are on the way to challenge them and they seem almost unstoppable at that!
Announcer: THE SUNBREAD SQUAD!
Announcer: That'd make them the first group fighting for baked goods to enter this arena! Let's just hope that they only fight FOR the bread and not LIKE the bread!
Announcer: They can fight better than you'd expect from bread! And hey, maybe their vision isn't so grainy after all. We'll just have to wheat and seed what happens!
Cibon: Ugh... It's so terrible.
<# Seems like you have a crummy taste for humor!
Announcer: The bread that everyone loaves! Their crust as hard as steel and as sharp as the finest smithing. One enemy after another, their plans have yet to go a-rye! <# Can conveniently be interpreted as "loves" or "loathes", even though "loathes" is what I intended.
Cibon: Can someone just tell this guy that he's not even funny at all?
<# There's no escaping my punitentiary now!
Announcer: THE BRIGANTINE PRIDE!
Announcer: Brigantine... Pride?
Announcer: Of course! The pride of our nation! Here in our prison! Our model prisoners! If only everyone in Brigantia behaved like our humble friends here!
Announcer: Oh yeah... IF WE WERE TO PICK ANY SOLDIER FROM THE BRIGANTINE ORDER, THE RESEMBLANCE WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE DAY AND NIGHT! Wouldn't that be great? <# (We could attribute the honor of every Brigantian soldier to be exactly like these three!)
Cibon: I saw this coming miles away...
Soko: We'll see who gets the last laugh!
Announcer: Oh yeah! Our model prisoners again! We can definitely be proud of our traitors. Now I think about it... shouldn't it be THE KORZOJENISH PRIDE instead?!
Soko: Damn...
Cibon: Truly an amazing name.
Announcer: They may have sold us to Korzojeno and stayed with us as prisoners, but they've shown us that their prowess is something to be proud of indeed!
Announcer: Yes, maybe even to all of Brigantia!
Soko: We didn't sell anyone out to Korzojeno, they just don't want to understand...
Kento: At least they're starting to take us seriously.
Announcer: THE TRAITORS!
Announcer: Well, well, well, if it isn't our colleagues from the Brigantine Order who'd rather work for our treacherous neighboring country!
Announcer: Now that they're stuck here in Brigantia, they won't be able to help out their client any longer! The only thing left for them do to is fight!
Announcer: And they're here to fight again! Obviously, there's nothing interesting to write to Korzojeno about here!
Soko: How often are they going to keep singling us out?
Announcer: They fight, oh how they keep fighting! We can be glad that they're doing it here and not in a battle for our neighboring country under the leadership of Farenia!
Cibon: The guy better be glad he's up there and not down here...
---
Announcer: And here comes their opponent!
Announcer: And here comes their next opponent!
Announcer: THE SLIMEALGAMATION!
Announcer: All beginners in this tournament must first battle their way through the guild of slimes!
Announcer: Although they rarely make it out of last place, there are people nonetheless who were taken down under their magical flames and water torrents!
Cibon: Hehe, quite some losers, aren't they, Kento?
Kento: Be quiet.
Soko: Huh?
Announcer: THE PACK!
Announcer: We found them in the darkest stretches of the Silvan Forest and it wasn't easy to bring them here to the arena!
Announcer: But now that they're here, they'll show their opponents what the rules of the wild look like!
Cibon: Damn, just a few wolves.
Announcer: THE BEAR BROTHERS!
Announcer: They're big, hairy, and strong! Many weapons have failed to do anything because of their thick fur. And they know how to hit back!
Announcer: THE FEJAR SLITTERS!
Announcer: Too bad they don't have any Fejar to slit. Regardless, they're quick, agile, and know how to whittle down their opponents!
Announcer: THE TERROR FROM BELOW!
Announcer: Yep, they're the very creatures that haunt all the miners here! Now they'd even go so far as to intimidate these fighters!
Announcer: THE SHADOW CRAWLERS!
Announcer: They know how to stab their opponents in the back. Their deadly technique kills the victim before they even notice anything!
Announcer: But don't underestimate them now! Their technique is as deadly in the open air as it is in a shrouded night!
Announcer: THE EXOTICS!
Announcer: Nobody knows where exactly they came from, but their combat techniques are second to none on the continent of Tora! Their opponent will have to adjust to something completely different!
Announcer: THE KNIGHTS OF NIGHT!
Announcer: Their mighty appearance in dark armor has made many opponents tremble at the sight of them right before battle! But their appearance isn't merely for show!
Announcer: Many opponents have failed on their defense!
Announcer: THE AVENGERS OF THE JUST!
Announcer: They steal from the rich and give it to the poor, or so they say. Too bad there's no property for the prisoners of this prison!
Announcer: But their leader actually knows how to handle bows! Their opponent should be cautious!
Announcer: THE ZINKAR BROTHERS!
Announcer: This group really rose through the ranks quickly! With their extraordinary teamwork, they were able to make it this far!
Announcer: With some daggers, a claw, and a fighting stick, they've already taught many opponents a lesson they won't forget!
Announcer: THE PAUAMAINER VETERANS!
Announcer: Many opponents have fallen to their deadly ore mining technique! And when someone still stood, they had the misfortune of being barraged by the fire of their dynamite arrows!
Announcer: THE BOSS HIMSELF!
Announcer: As the leader of the Pauamainer Brotherhood, he has consistently held his rank in 1st place for ages and he doesn't intend to hand that over anytime soon!
Announcer: And anyone who challenges him gets a barrage of thundering strikes and catastrophic cyclones in response! Another battle of the ages dawns upon us!
Announcer: The leader of the Pauamainer Brotherhood and the longest-standing leader in the history of our tournament! He was dethroned from 1st place.
Announcer: Will he be able to reclaim his place at the top? Another epic battle lies ahead!
Announcer: GET READY TO RUMBLE!

<# AND THE CROWD GOES WILD!!
Announcer: The Zinkar Butchers shall slaughter all opponents in order to reach their final target! Another victory for them!
Announcer: The Zinkar Butchers have come a step closer to their goal! Another victory. The Zinkar Brothers better be prepared!
Announcer: As it turns out, the Sunbread Squad is really tough! This opponent will have to go against the grain to get rid of the bitter taste of defeat!
Cibon: Oh GOD...
Announcer: The Sunbread Squad wins! What a battle! They're really making the dough with this one!
Cibon: What a loser!
Announcer: The Brigantine Pride has won, as expected from our model prisoners!
Announcer: The Brigantine Pride has won! Showed 'em the Brigantian spirit! We're all very proud of you.
Cibon: Thanks a lot.
Soko: ...
Announcer: The Traitors are victorious! Korzojeno must really regret losing these capable people!
Announcer: The Traitors have won! Korzojeno seems to have a good grasp when choosing their spies!
Announcer: Your current rank is \v[1886].
Announcer: So how about it? Are you ready to take on another opponent?
Announcer: Actually, here's something to note since you're new. You have no way to change what equipment you have or gather any extra equipment and we won't heal you up.
Announcer: You can only heal yourself with any existing items and can only change your equipment if you have extras.
Announcer: So, do you want to take on another opponent?
Continue fighting?
Announcer: Our winner is ready to take on another opponent! Everyone have a round of applause for this team!
Announcer: The Zinkar Butchers have had enough for today. Tomorrow's a new day! The Zinkar Brothers can't run forever!
Announcer: The Sunbread Squad has had enough for today. Seems like they weren't completely baked after all!
Cibon: ARGH!
Announcer: The Brigantine Pride is done flaunting their honor for the day, or lack thereof. Hopefully, we'll have the opportunity to behold our model prisoners again tomorrow!
Announcer: The Traitors have fought enough for today. Now they can go back to their cells where they belong.
Soko: KILL!!!!1
Note: These were just Soko's thoughts.
Announcer: This is the last battle of the day for the Zinkar Butchers. Tomorrow's a new day! The Zinkar Brothers can't run forever!
Announcer: This is the last battle of the day for the Sunbread Squad. Seems like they weren't completely baked after all!
Cibon: ARGH!
Announcer: This is the last time we have to see the Brigantine Pride flaunt their honor, or lack thereof. Hopefully, we'll have the opportunity to behold our model prisoners again tomorrow!
Announcer: This is the last battle of the day for the Traitors! Now they can go back to their cells where they belong.
Soko: KILL!!!!1
Note: These were just Soko's thoughts.
Announcer: The Zinkar Butchers have lost. What a shame! Will they ever reach their archenemies like this?
Announcer: And just like that, the Sunbread Squad is toast! Were they just loafing around?
Cibon: Ouch... And I'm not saying that just because of some wounds!
Announcer: Our model prisoners were beaten! So how about that? How are we supposed to be proud of such a group?
Announcer: Unfortunately, they were nothing! The traitors were beaten! Yep, that's exactly what we want to see!

Saion: Hmpf! We'll win our tournament place back, just you wait!
Jorn: I see many months of cruel battles coming on me. Someone get me out of here, please!
Saion: Jorn, will you please stop complaining all the time?
Saion: Gurim and I survive the whole thing without complaining! So get yourself together!
Jorn: We all know by now that you like to be beaten up, and that Gurim never complains as well!
Jorn: Nobody is forcing us to do all these fights, have you ever thought of it?
Jorn: Damn, by now I would even prefer to work regularly in the mine instead of performing in the tournament again!
Saion: I am doing my best here to create a good reputation for us here and to move us forward!
Saion: And everything you do is gripe, gripe, gripe! You should be grateful to me for pulling you along at all!
Jorn: GRATEFUL ?! It is YOUR fault that we ended up here in the first place! Just because you absolutely wanted your fight back then!
Jorn: And even here fighting is the only thing you can think of!
Saion: I've told you several times! This life is in our blood! We, with the last name Zinkar, never lose out!
Saion: But what am I wondering at all. Of course you don't understand that! You are the BLACK SHEEP of the three of us!
Jorn: Right! I am the black sheep!
Jorn: Right! I am the black sheep! LUCKILY!
Jorn: Otherwise I would have this
Jorn: Otherwise I would have this IDIOT BLOOD in me that everyone
Jorn: Otherwise I would have this IDIOT BLOOD in me, which TAKES ALL MIND and one for me
Jorn: Otherwise I would have this IDIOT BLOOD in me that TAKES ALL MIND and gives me a THICK SKULL!
Saion: WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ?! COME BACK IMMEDIATELY!
Cibon: W ... what was that now ...
Soko: Gurim ... What was Jorn talking about?
Gurim: ... It's been a little while since they had an argument ...
Gurim: Jorn ... is really just a half brother of us ... Is a complicated subject ... < It's complicated...
Gurim: In any case, Saion doesn't manage to overlook this thing ...
Gurim: Excuse me, but I should make sure the two are right ...
Soko: ... It seems there is something more behind all the arguments ...
Kento: It's not that we have to play psychiatrists here. It is their business and we should not interfere.

Felcis: So my friend, we won, you know what that means? Bring the clunker. < Hand it over.
Robin: Yes, yes. Alright. You were lucky this time. You can have your stone.
Robin: The next time we meet in the tournament, it won't be that easy for you!
---
Pauamainer Member: That was a top performance from you today! We haven't had such good opponents in a long time!
Pauamainer Member: Have a look at our base if you already belong to the Pauamainer underground brotherhood! We might have something for you.

...

<# ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!
Insane Girl: Ah! There you are again! What was going on?
Insane Girl: Well, where did I stop ... Hmm ... Oh yeah!
Insane Girl: I feel like accompanying you in the future. It's okay, isn't it?
Kento: Uhhhm ... well ...
Cibon: buddy, RACE!
Cibon: ARE YOU MADNESS ?! Do you want us all to get on our nerves?
Kento: The ... The question came so suddenly and unexpectedly! I wasn't prepared for it ...
---
Blonde Girl: Oh, hello! What are you doing here Somehow everything is so dark and dark here, isn't it? < Oh, hey there!
Cibon: No matter how gloomy and dark it may be here, the presence of your beauty alone makes any desolation go away!
Blonde Girl: wow! How long has it been since I got such a great compliment!
Blonde Girl: the people here are all so grumpy and in a bad mood, but you're totally different! Great!
Blonde Girl: I thought my life had only been going downhill since I landed here.
Blonde Girl: And only because of a little theft! < And all because
Insane Girl: I just wanted to help two other people who were totally desperate.
Insane Girl: completely stupid! And now I have to work here in this terrible mine! It is exhausting!
Cibon: J ... Yes ... Really hard times here ...
Insane Girl: Yes! Exactly! It's great to have someone you can tell everything about, really! Knew what's going on here
It's great to have someone you can tell everything about, really! Did you know what happened to me here yesterday? I sat on

Cibon: buddy! Let's get out of here!
Kento: ... insane. That you literally run away from a woman. What else I can experience.
Cibon: THERE ARE YOU WONDERFUL !? This brat would have cut my last nerves within the next 4 minutes!
Kento: Well, you have to admit. It was quite "entertaining".
Cibon: ... I want to have missed that ... < Let's... just forget that that ever happened...

Prisoner: We are staring with particular interest at the wall that you are currently able to cover. Get out of here.

...

Robin: We'll see you in the tournament then, haha!

Robin: Now you have your clunker again, I hope you are satisfied! But just wait! You rich bags will experience your downfall sooner or later!
Felcis: Ignore it. Simply ignore...

Prisoner: We give it to the poor because they really need it, oh yes we do!

Prisoner: We steal from the rich to make them less rich, oh yes we do!

Saion: You again. We'll see each other again in the tournament, just wait!
Soko: What's going on between you? You should talk about your problems instead of ...
Saion: Our problems? What is it that interests you? Take care of your own stuff!
Kento: Come on Soko, better leave it ...
Saion: Pah! The fact that you hit again means nothing! I demand revenge!
Jorn: Rule number one of the Zinkar brothers: We never learn our lesson!
Saion: Jorn, you kindly keep your cheeky mouth!
Saion: Ha! The Zinkar butchers are progressing, it seems. You will be surprised who slaughters whom!
Jorn: Your name is on the agenda!
Saion: Shut up, Jorn!
Saion: Place \ v [1886] are you already now? Not long now and our fight is imminent! Oh yeah!
Jorn: Oh joy.
Saion: Do you see? Even this stubborn redhead from brother is looking forward to this fight!
Jorn: Stubborn brother? Someone must have stuck a mirror to me somewhere.
Saion: What does that mean again ?!
Saion: Oh hello! There are the "Zinkar butchers"! Pretty self-confident when choosing a name, I just say!
Jorn: I already feel like fresh meat. < to be sliced
Saion: Quiet, Jorn! You always with your pessimistic manner.
Saion: Ha! And? What rank do you have now? We are all waiting impatiently for your challenge!
Jorn: Are we doing this?
Saion: We'll prove we can take on brigand order soldiers!
Jorn: You can just attack a couple of guards if you want to prove it.
Saion: Be quiet, Jorn!

Jorn: ... please leave me in peace, yes?
Jorn: I hope you had fun. You can try to fight these Pauamainers. They are really violent.
Jorn: I have to know, as often as Saion has taken on us ... And her boss is beyond our borders anyway ...
Saion: This is so typical of you again! Just howling and whining!
Jorn: After half a dozen defeats against this guy, I have every reason to do so!
Jorn: It looks like it will soon be a "slaughter festival". And I thought that ambition would only have this blue-haired mischief from brother.
Jorn: Well, wonderful, you are getting closer and closer to our place. You really mean it, don't you?
Cibon: Come on, it's just a tournament fight. And your brother didn't want it any other way.
Jorn: Yes, but I'm being dragged into this mess. Nobody asks me!
Soko: Believe me, on our side it's not necessarily that different.
Cibon: How, where, what? You never really complained, Soko!
Soko: So what? That doesn't mean that I like the stuff.
Jorn: Hey, I think we understand each other then.
Jorn: Come on, Soko, we're making a pact! We both will just go on strike and do nothing during the fight!
Soko: Sounds interesting.
Cibon: Now don't get stupid thoughts!
Jorn: Zinkar Butcher ... Very great name choice. Now I can't sleep peacefully during the night.
Saion: You're such a scaredy bunny! What does a name mean? You can see how far we've come!
Jorn: What? Fear is such a wonderful thing. It keeps you from doing stupid things.
Jorn: And some people here could really use a little more fear ...
Jorn: You really don't have to hurry with this tournament story.
Jorn: I'm really happy if my brother can't find an opponent to fight for a day ...
Soko: May I ask why you are doing everything your brother imposes on you?
Soko: You don't seem to agree very often ...
Jorn: Well ... um ... we're brothers?
Jorn: It's not that I know people I could go to when I leave my brothers.
Jorn: Besides, you can't imagine what kind of theater Saion would do in this case ...
Saion: What are you talking about over there?
Jorn: We are currently discussing whether your actions are due to a lack of intelligence or a mental disorder.
Saion: What the ... I act exactly as we have to act as a gang of thieves!
Jorn: Yes, you could really discuss the topic for a long time.

Gurim: ...
Gurim: Congratulations on your victory.
Cibon: Thank you, you fought well too.
Gurim: We'll see you in the tournament ...
Cibon: I'm curious to see if your fighting style has improved with this strange weapon.
Kento: Speaking of weird weapons. Are you still struggling with this filled pouch, Jorn?
Jorn: The one? No way! We wouldn't have enough items to fill it with a solid weight.
Kento: What are you fighting with?
Jorn: Well ... you'll see ...
Gurim: Hello ...
Soko: You are really a welcome change compared to your talkative brothers.
Gurim: D ... thank you ...
