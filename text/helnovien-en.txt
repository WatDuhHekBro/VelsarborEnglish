Guard: To get to the canteen, go through this corridor past all the cells while staying on the ground floor, then turn right.
#
Prisoner: Sometimes I really have the feeling that better equipment in the tournament brings more than fighting talent.
Prisoner: How else can you explain to me that these Pauamain veterans are always up there? Of course, because they dig a lot of ore and therefore get a lot of tournament coins!
Prisoner: And a lot of tournament coins mean better equipment, as you probably already know.

Guard: This area is only to be entered by those fighting in the tournament!

Guard: If you want to get into the arena and fight, you'll have to register first. Registration is in the cafe.

Prisoner: Somehow I feel sorry for "The Slimy". They are constantly beaten down by any newcomer.
Prisoner: There are even a few lower places that are so brazen to fight and hit them just like that, even though they are ranked below them! Just out of frustration because they can't get anywhere!
Prisoner: For my part, I'm happy about every slimy victory, even if it happens only rarely!

Prisoner: I'm curious to see who will make it through this time.

Old Prisoner: It is always good to see that there are prisoners who come up against the underground fright. These are the very beasts that lurk in the mine below.
Old Prisoner: So you can always hope to get help down there if you're really chased by something like that.
Old Prisoner: In daylight, these beings look much more harmless anyway!

Prisoner: Exotics are my personal favorite here! They have such a surprising fighting style.
Prisoner: In the beginning it seems that they are not up to the task and the opponent will win, but after a few rounds they really get going!
Prisoner: Many opponents have already fallen for this tactic!

Prisoner: These Avengers of the Righteous are a strange association. They are constantly talking about just redistribution of property.
Prisoner: These guys came from Helnovia. There is not much to redistribute here. Since the war there have been only poor people with very few exceptions.
Prisoner: But your archer has what it takes, you have to give them that. I have rarely seen so many arrows fly at once!

Prisoner: It doesn't happen very often that "The Boss" is challenged, but when it does, it's always a spectacle.
Prisoner: The boss is fighting alone and has so far easily taken on any group that wanted to bring him down.
Prisoner: Too bad the Pauamain veterans have since given up chasing him from 1st place.
Prisoner: But these new ones there, these Zinkar brothers, have been trying it lately. The newcomers really bring a breath of fresh air to this tournament!

Prisoner: These shadow crawlers are really a group that I don't want to run into at night. They are scary and cruel enough during the day!
Prisoner: And if they do their foggy clothing on themselves, their opponent sees them as badly as if it were actually night.

Prisoner: Hehe! The fights so far have been pretty great! It's always worth being there.
Prisoner: When does it finally start? I don't want to wait any longer ...
Kento: What kind of open space is this? And what are all the people doing here?
Prisoner: You don't know that? Some tournament fights take place here. There are almost every day. Any prisoner can participate.
Soko: But what should you get out of it, please?
Prisoner: A call here in prison. People who do well at tournaments are treated with more respect by the other prisoners.
Prisoner: At the same time, it is entertainment for the other prisoners who are watching.
Prisoner: I heard that before the tournament fights were introduced there were significantly more uprisings and problems with the prisoners.

Prisoner: These tournament fights are really pretty much the only fun we have left in this prison.
Prisoner: Fortunately, there are enough volunteers who actually want to hit their heads at the end of the day ...

Guard: Prisoners have no business here!

...

Prisoner: As you can see over there, there are also plenty of guards who watch the tournament fights.
Prisoner: Some of us are really wondering if they introduced the tournament mainly for their own entertainment ...

Prisoner: Pretty good view from here, right? But I would not dare to get too close to the parapet. We have had cases where prisoners fell from here ...

Prisoner: If the boss is fighting here, you have to be up here! If you use your secret attack, you can still feel the wind up here!

Prisoner: The guy there looks very classy. How does something like this get into prison here? And why is something blocking my view here?
Prisoner: If the fighting really starts here, it is often very crowded up here. You get really afraid that you could fall down ...

Prisoner: These "knights of the night" are pretty smart, I tell you.
Prisoner: When most of the fighters figured out that they were very vulnerable to magic, they changed their tactics.
Prisoner: Now they conjure up "reflection" on themselves! It's always great to see how stunned the wizards look when they get their spell thrown back!

Announcer: Our next fight is just around the corner! The first participant enters the arena!
Announcer: The ZINKAR SLAYERS!
Announcer: Oha! This group has set itself a goal! But this is still far away, a long way through the ranking is waiting for you!
Announcer: Let's hope that your name says it all!
Announcer: Slowly but surely they are getting closer to their goal! Will they hold out until the bitter end? And are they really up to their archenemy when the time comes?
Cibon: And whether we are!
Announcer: You want to see Zinkar blood! The brothers should be careful! Your archenemy is on the way to them and seems almost unstoppable!
Announcer: ... The REPSBROT TROOPS!
Announcer: This would be the first bakery company to enter this arena! Let's hope for them that they only fight for the bread and not LIKE the bread!
Announcer: You can fight better than you would expect from bread! But let's wait and see! Perhaps the opponent with the bread knife will find the end of their way!
Cibon: Urgs ... it was really bad.
Announcer: The bread that everyone fears! Her crust hard as steel and sharp as the finest blacksmithing. One enemy after the other they got stuck in their necks!
Cibon: Can anyone tell this guy he's not funny?
Announcer: The BRIGANT PRIDE!
Announcer: ... brigands ... proud?
Announcer: Of course! The pride of our nation! Here in our prison! Our model prisoners! If only everyone in Brigantia behaved like our humble friends here!
Announcer: Oh yes ... WE WOULD COUNT THE ENTIRE BRIGAN ORDER TO OUR PARTICIPANTS! Wouldn't that be great?
Cibon: It was so clear that it went like this ... < I saw this coming miles away...
Soko: We'll see who ends up laughing here! < We'll see who gets the last laugh!
Announcer: Oh yes! Our role model prisoners again! We can certainly be proud of our traitors. If I think about it ... shouldn't it rather be KORZOJENOS PROUD ?!
Soko: ... Damn ...
Cibon: Really an excellent name choice.
Announcer: They may have sold us to Korzojeno and stayed with us prisoners, but they have shown us that their martial art is indeed something to be proud of!
Announcer: Yes, maybe all of Brigantia!
Soko: We didn't sell anything to Korzojeno, they just don't want to understand it ...
Kento: At least they're starting to take us seriously.
Announcer: THE TRAITOR!
Announcer: If not our colleagues from the brigand order who would rather work for our treacherous neighboring country!
Announcer: Now you are here in Brigantia, but you will no longer be able to help your client! The only thing left for them is to fight!
Announcer: And here they are again to fight! Obviously there is nothing interesting to tell Korzojeno here!
Soko: ... how often do you want to hack on it?
Announcer: They fight, oh yes and how they fight! We can be glad that they are doing it here and not in a battle with our neighboring country under the leadership of Farenia!
Cibon: The guy can also be very glad that he's not down here ...
Announcer: And here comes your opponent!
Announcer: And here comes the next opponent!
Announcer: THE SLIMGY!
Announcer: All beginners in this tournament have to fight their way through this association of Glibber first!
Announcer: Although they are rarely ranked higher than the last, there were already people who were founded under their magical flames and water fountains!
Cibon: Hey, what losers, aren't you mate?
Kento: Be quiet.
Soko: Huh?
Announcer: THE PACKAGE!
Announcer: We found them in the darkest region of the Silvanwald and it wasn't easy to bring them here to the arena!
Announcer: But now they are here and they will show their opponents what the rules of the wild look like!
Cibon: Damn it just a few wolves.
Announcer: THE BEAR BROTHERS!
Announcer: They are big, furry and strong! Many weapons have failed because of their thick fur. And they know how to hit back!
Announcer: THE FEJAR SLITTERS!
Announcer: Too bad that the participants here don't have any Fejar to cut them off. Nevertheless, they are quick, agile and know how to restrict their opponents!
Announcer: THE UNDERGROUND TERROR!
Announcer: Right, it is exactly the beasts that are feared by all mine workers here! Now they even go so far as to threaten the tournament fighters!
Announcer: THE SHADOWSLEEPS!
Announcer: You know how to stab your opponent in the back. Your deadly technique kills the victim before they notice anything!
Announcer: But don't misjudge them! Your combat technique is as deadly in the open as it is in the dark night!
Announcer: THE EXOTICS!
Announcer: Nobody knows exactly where they come from, but their combat technology is second to none on the Toras continent! Your opponent will have to adjust to something completely new!
Announcer: THE KNIGHTS OF THE NIGHT!
Announcer: Your mighty appearance in dark armor has made many opponents tremble! But their appearance is not a spectacle!
Announcer: Many opponents have failed on their defensive!
Announcer: THE AVENGER OF THE RIGHTS!
Announcer: They steal from the rich and give it to the poor, they say. Too bad that there is no property for the prisoners here in prison!
Announcer: But their leader actually knows how to handle the bows! Your opponent should be careful!
Announcer: THE ZINCAR BROTHERS!
Announcer: This group really got up quickly! With their extraordinary teamwork they have made it far!
Announcer: With a dagger, claw and fighting stick they have already taught many opponents a lesson!
Announcer: THE PAUAMAIN VETERANS!
Announcer: Many opponents have perished from their deadly ore mining technique! And when someone was still standing, he had to swallow the fire of her dynamite arrows!
Announcer: THE CHEF MOST PERSONAL!
Announcer: The leader of the Pauamainer, he has been in first place for ages and he does not intend to hand him over!
Announcer: And everyone who questions this place gets thunder slides and cyclones in response! Another epic battle is upon us!
Announcer: The leader of the Pauamain team and the longest leader in our tournament history. Now he was beaten and lost his first place.
Announcer: Will he be able to fight him back? Another big fight is ahead!
Announcer: LET THE FIGHT BEGIN! <? GET READY TO RUMBLE!

Announcer: The Zinkar butchers slaughter all opponents to reach their final victim! Another win for them!
Announcer: The Zinkar butchers have come a step closer to their goal! Another win. The Zinkar brothers should be ready!
Announcer: The Repsbrot troop turns out to be really tough! This opponent will have to chew their opponents for a long time!
Cibon: Oh GOD ...
Announcer: The Repsbrot troop wins! What a fight! Blood and sweat flowed and reps cores flew!
Cibon: What a pipe!
Announcer: The brigand pride has won, as expected from our role model prisoners!
Announcer: The brigand pride has won! Did her great! We are all very proud of you.
Cibon: Thank you very much.
Soko: ...
Announcer: The traitors are victorious! Korzojeno must really regret losing these capable people!
Announcer: The traitors have won! Korzojeno seems to have a good grasp when choosing her spies!
Announcer: Your current rank is \ v [1886]
Announcer: How's it going? Are you ready to take on another opponent?
Announcer: A note because you are new. You have no way to reassemble or top up your equipment and you will not be healed.
Announcer: You can only heal yourself with existing items and change your armor if you have something to change.
Announcer: So, do you want to fight again?
Fight Again?
Announcer: Our winner is ready to take on another opponent! Applause for this participant!
Announcer: The Zinkar butchers have enough for today. Tomorrow is a new day! The Zinkar brothers will not run away after all!
Announcer: The Repsbrot troop has enough for today. Come on! You can curl up now!
Cibon: ARGS!
Announcer: The brigante pride has shone enough for today. Hopefully tomorrow we will have the opportunity to marvel at our model prisoners again!
Announcer: The traitors have fought enough for today. Now they can go back to their cells where they belong.
Soko: KILL !!!! 1
Note: These were Soko's thoughts.
Announcer: This was the last battle of the Zinkar butchers. Tomorrow is a new day! The Zinkar brothers will not run away after all!
Announcer: For today this was the last fight of the Repsbrot troop. Come on! You can curl up now!
Cibon: ARGS!
Announcer: This was the last fight of brigant pride, for today. Hopefully tomorrow we will have the opportunity to marvel at our model prisoners again!
Announcer: That was the last traitor fight for today! Now they can go back to their cells where they belong.
Soko: KILL !!!! 1
Note: These were Soko's thoughts.
Announcer: The Zinkar butchers have lost. What a shame! Will they ever reach their archenemy like this?
Announcer: The Repsbrot troop was beaten. Well, people like you are eaten here for breakfast!
Cibon: ... Ouch! And I'm not saying that because of any wounds!
Announcer: Our model prisoners were beaten! So how does something go? How should we be proud of such a group, please?
Announcer: Unfortunately that was nothing! The traitors were beaten! Yes, we like to see something like that!

Felcis: Oh? Are you up here too? It's nice that the guards give the prisoners so much free rein here.
Felcis: The tournament is also quite entertaining, if a little barbaric for my taste. < albeit

$
Guard: ALL PRISONERS GET BACK INTO THEIR CELLS IMMEDIATELY!
Felcis: Cieoly, I really didn't need that to happen just now.
Prisoner: Ooo, what's this? A beautiful sparkling stone! New stolen goods, har har har!
Felcis: What the...! Bad luck twice in a row. I definitely didn't plan for it to go this way.

$
Guard: ALL PRISONERS GET BACK INTO THEIR CELLS IMMEDIATELY!
Felcis: So, Cieoly. You know where this message is supposed to go, right? Don't mess that up now.
Felcis: Keep your fingers crossed for me. If everything goes well, I'll give you something nice to snack on tomorrow. Outside these walls.

Royko: Oh! There you are. I finally meet you again.
Kento: Um, hello?
Royko: I'm Royko! The guy from the bridge. From the Toras Mountains.
Soko: Royko ... Oh, right! I remember. And you are here in prison now?
Royko: Yes, as I told you ... But ... How did you end up here? What did you do
Soko: We are wrongly locked up here! We are believed to be traitors, but we are not!
Royko: I've already heard this espionage story. I also couldn't imagine that you would do something like this ...
Cibon: Hey, would you be able to somehow get us out of here?
Royko: I you guys here? ... No, I'm sorry. Escaping Helnovia is pretty much impossible ...
Royko: As a single guard, there is nothing I can do about it.
Kento: It doesn't have to flee right away. Couldn't you put in a good word for us to be released?
Royko: Release? Here in Helnovien? They usually don't leave people free here ...
Soko: Please ?!
Royko: That is, as long as there is still room in prison or they are not strictly ordered by the government ...
Royko: As a lonely guard, there is nothing I can do about it ... Especially not with the leadership we have at the moment ...
Kento: Oh, who is that at the moment?
Royko: ... who is what?
Kento: ... The leadership ...
Royko: Oh, that's Sir Dolaros. He's not been here too long, but we all already know how stubborn he is.
Royko: Rethinking him with words is usually impossible ...
Kento: Is that such a stocky person with short, blonde hair?
Royko: Yes, exactly like that ...
Guard: Hey, you over there! What are you talking to the prisoners Go back to your post!
Royko: Z ... At your command!
Royko: I'm sorry, I have to keep going.
Cibon: Until then, colleague ...
Cibon: ... These are really wonderful prospects here ...
Soko: How did we deserve all this ...
Kento: It looks like we're being interrogated here personally by the prison leadership.
Kento: Quite strange, actually, that no subordinate does that.

...

Felcis: It looks like we have everything together. That means we can get started as soon as you are ready.
Felcis: We don't have to do it today, but we can't wait too long either.
Felcis: I will hang out here in the canteen every evening after work. Let me know when you're ready.
Kento: One more question, Felcis. We are now able to break the barrier, but what about the rest?
Kento: Just because the barrier is broken doesn't mean that we can walk out comfortably.
Felcis: You are absolutely right. However, I already have a plan for how to distract the guards.
Felcis: I'll tell you when we start the operation.
Felcis: Talk to me in the canteen when you're ready.
Kento: This Felcis really has its way of enlightening us at the last possible moment ...

Prisoner: If you mine a little too little ore, you get less food here. They don't care what your physical condition is.
Prisoner: That means: those who are old and weak get less to eat and become even weaker.

Prisoner: The food here is really cruel. But the main thing is that you get full. < The food here is horrendous. But all that matters

Prisoner: The glow of the walls irritates me ... I thought I would get used to it over time, but it just doesn't let up.
Prisoner: That's why I can hardly sleep in my cell at night ... If only I had something to cover the walls with - but no, prisoners don't have any.

Prisoner: Have you run into this blonde general before? Sir Dolaros is his name. What a man!
Prisoner: I've heard that he interrogates certain prisoners every now and then and gets really hard at it ...
Prisoner: Oh yeah ... I wish I were the prisoner he would interrogate ...
Kento: D ... That ... I have no words.
Cibon: ... I ... I don't know where to start ... < I don't even know where to begin...
Soko: So ... So wrong, that's so wrong!

Prisoner: Ah, the ex-soldiers of the brigand order. I am hardly surprised that there is also a woman with you.
Prisoner: That comes from putting genders in roles where they just don't fit! I would also go crazy if I kept standing in front of the stove!
Soko: So ... such a cheeky cheek! The fact that I'm here in prison has never removed my ...
Kento: It's good, Soko. Just ignore, just ignore.
Prisoner: Leave me alone.

Prisoner: Did you already notice that they even let monsters take part in the tournament fights? These are some pseudo teams that are kept by the guards.
Prisoner: But what I'm wondering ... Where do you lock the critters when they're not in the arena?

Prisoner: Today I saw one of those nasty, magical worms down there in the mine. At this sight I always lose my appetite for the rest of the day.
Kento: Is there anything left with you?
Soko: You keep that nice, Kento!

Prisoner: I was in a prison in Domarkor before - those were tough times. There you had absolutely no free run and there was food every 2 to 3 days.
Prisoner: This is less a prison than a labor camp if you ask me. Brigantia really seems to be primarily concerned with iron.

Prisoner: I really can't understand all of these people who are still playing or watching the tournament after work. All I want is back in my cell.

Prisoner: If you wonder what this platform is up there for - guards occasionally stand there and announce things to all the prisoners in the canteen.
Prisoner: It would be better not to put yourself up there and do some nonsense. The guards are extremely reluctant to see this.

Prisoner: I've been here for 3 weeks now ... I hate it, how could I end up here? All I did was pickpocket ...
Prisoner: And now I'm here and toil to death. I miss my family...
Soko: Crimes have to be punished ...
Cibon: Yes, but something because of a little pickpocketing? Don't you think that goes a little too far?
Kento: I think the problem is that all prisoners face the same fate here, regardless of why.
Prisoner: But what I'm wondering ... Where do you lock the critters when they're not in the arena?

Prisoner: Damn, I'm still hungry, but there is no reference! I have to work harder to make my portion bigger ...
Soko: The idea of motivating the prisoners with the food rations seems to work very well ...
Soko: How pitiful.
Cibon: Tomorrow we're going to do our best, aren't we, buddy?
Kento: You say it! The portions have to be bigger.
Soko: ... so pitiful ...

Cibon: There's barely anything to eat!
Kento: ...so hungry...
Soko: Oh what'd they say again? That if we do badly in the mine, we won't get any food... They really were serious...
Cibon: We gotta give it our all Kento, otherwise we won't last much longer!
Kento: Yeah...
Cibon: I'm still hungry... But I think I'll survive.
Kento: I don't. I'm gonna starve to death tonight.
Cibon: Pull yourself together, Kento! If you really want to have more food, we have to put a little more effort down in the mine.
Soko: I thought it was enough... really...
Cibon: Hey, that was more than I expected. I'm full.
Kento: Well, this should be enough... to survive at least...
Soko: More than enough actually...
Cibon: Whoa! I'm completely full! I never dreamed that they'd give us so much food!
Cibon: Obviously, we did a very good job in the mine... Yep, that's how it works!
Soko: Oh, I can't finish all of this... It's too much for me...
Kento: Can I have the rest?
Soko: So what happens now? It's late afternoon, so are we just going to be locked back in our cells and that's it for the day?
Cibon: Hm... Didn't you notice how many people were out there? Apparently, something's still going on.
????: Well, well, well... Take a look at who we have here! What a coincidence!
Cibon: W... What?! You're here too?
Saion: Are you so surprised? Which prison can we, the dreaded Zinkar Brothers, hold if it's not that of Helnovien?
Saion: We'd break out of every other cell, we'd outsmart all the other guards!
Saion: But not in Helnovien! This prison is just safe enough to keep us here and nothing less!
Jorn: You probably already realize how desperate he's becoming. He's proud to be LOCKED UP here.
Saion: Quiet, Jorn! Nobody asked you!
Saion: But isn't it a wonderful coincidence that we met you here? Fate seems to work well with us!
Jorn: Yes exactly, after fate was so kind enough to lock us up here.
Jorn: I'd at least say that, if it weren't for the stupidity of a certain person around here who's responsible for it.
Saion: I told you to be quiet, Jorn!
Saion: You've probably heard of the tournament, haven't you?
---
Saion: No? Still so new and fresh out of the water are you?
Saion: The tournament is for the cool people here in prison! Anyone who wants to can try their hand at it when the day's over.
Saion: The battles are always fought in groups. The best way is to form a group of three, which suits us perfectly!
Saion: Every group has its rank, and newcomers always start at the bottom. You can then challenge other groups with a similar rank!
Saion: And that's exactly what I'm looking forward to!
---
Saion: Excellent!
---
Saion: We challenge you to a duel! Although we'd like for it to happen, your rank as a newcomer is far too low right now!
Saion: You'll have to fight your way up in the tournament before you can compete against us!
Saion: So I'm counting on you.
Saion: On the other hand, you can consider us the winner if you can't reach our rank!
Soko: One question... What... do you actually get from these battles?
Soko: How... How do you still have enough energy for this kind of theater with all the mine work?
Jorn: You know, I keep asking him the same question, and yet he always drags me into this mess.
Saion: Women like you are unlikely to understand this! It's about honor and proof of strength!
Jorn: There's also a real advantage. They even make you skip mining every now and then if you're good enough.
Saion: Yes... But that's irrelevant! In any case, I hope I can count on you.
Gurim: One question... How'd you ended up here?
Kento: That's a somewhat complicated story...
Jorn: Weren't you three soldiers, or am I wrong? You can just say you're these traitors to the country that everyone says.
Soko: We didn't betray our country! We were wrongly locked up here...
Cibon: A certain old geezer thought we were malicious spies working for Korzojeno.
Kento: And since this "old geezer" is a member of the council, you can easily guess why we're here now.
Jorn: Heh. That's fate for ya. I think everyone has something like this one way or another. I've had the misfortune of having him as my brother and you've had yours with that old geezer.
Saion: What are you two still doing loitering around there? We have nothing to discuss with our archenemies!
Jorn: Please don't take this lunatic seriously. He's the only one of us who actually sees you as archenemies.
Jorn: You're just a scapegoat for his own stupidity.
Saion: Jorn!
Jorn: Yeah yeah!
Jorn: Well, see you around.
Soko: Those two made an unexpectedly decent impression...
Kento: Seems like Saion is the one who's dragging them down...
Cibon: That makes me wonder why those two always hang around him all the time then.
Kento: Who knows, they probably have their reasons...
Cibon: Hm, we should have a look at this tournament!
Soko: You actually want to go into that?
Cibon: We can't lose our fighting spirit here! And the tournament will help us with that!
Cibon: I also want to show Saion who's boss...
Cibon: I mean, come on. THEY have a higher rank than US? I can't sit by and let that continue!
Kento: You let yourself be provoked too easily, Cibon...
---\/
Kento: It occurs to me that today you are likely to question another one of us again. < I remembered that < It came to my mind that
Soko: That's right ...
Kento: I told them some stories recently ...
Kento: You should make sure that you base your statements on this. Otherwise our lies will be exposed.
Cibon: And then what?
Kento: Then there's a beating. Even during mine work, they threatened me.
Cibon: So what did you tell them?
Soko: Kento, if you see through our lies, you will think that we want to know and keep things secret, right?
Kento: ... you could be right ...
Soko: Lying is always only a temporary way out. And they can interrogate us here for months if they feel like it.
Soko: Telling you the truth may be harder at first, but it's the only way to end the interviews in the long run.
Cibon: Great, now I honestly don't know what to do.
Kento: Maybe Soko is right, it could make more sense to simply say permanently that you don't know anything.
Cibon: I think I'll decide when the time comes. Just tell me what you said to them.
---
Soko: I wonder what's going on outside. Did Brigantia find this group in the meantime?
Kento: Such news should spread quickly, even here in prison ...
Soko: If they discover the troop, it will probably be clear that we are not spies! Maybe we'll get out of here ...
Kento: Well, we heard yesterday that prisoners are usually not released here.
Kento: A big animal has to pull us out of here.
Soko: ...
Cibon: You could really be a little more optimistic, buddy. Our situation is desperate enough.
Cibon: They'll probably be questioning you today, Soko.
Soko: Yes ...
Kento: How are you going to behave now?
Soko: I don't know ... does it really make sense to tell them lies all the time?
Soko: We won't keep this up, so at least I won't ...
Soko: And it looks like we won't get out of here as soon ...
Kento: So you want to call innocence? You know that all our lies will be exposed.
Kento: Cibon and I will have to face the consequences ...
Soko: I ... I forgot ...
Cibon: Don't be considerate of me, Soko. They can't beat me up much more than last time.
Kento: Well, just do what you think is right. We'll get through this.
---
Kento: Oh, Felcis, I haven't quite understood one thing yet.
Kento: What does someone like you in this country have to do beyond the border? You said you were an envoy from the aristocracy ...
Felcis: Oh, well, I had an inspection job at the border.
Felcis: There have been a lot of rumors lately about an underground passage leading under the border.
Felcis: According to these rumors, this passage is due to the gangs of robbers roaming around here.
Felcis: I think it goes without saying that this is neither in the interests of Korzojeno nor Brigantia.
Felcis: After all, borders are not built so that you can walk freely underneath.
Felcis: So I was assigned a small group of soldiers to get to the bottom of it.
Felcis: And indeed. There was a passage. And their dimensions far exceeded my expectations.
Felcis: It's more than just a small tunnel. Rather, it is a large cave system that runs through the border.
Felcis: Big enough to lose his people there. This is exactly what happened to me when we were chased by a gang of robbers.
Felcis: I was lucky enough to find my way back in the end, but ended up in Brigantia.
Felcis: My people were still missing and since I'm not the type to let their people down, I wanted to ask for help here.
Felcis: And now I'm sitting here. And all I can do is hope that my people got away on their own.
Cibon: Okay ... that's pretty bad ...
Soko: What are they actually thinking here? They can't just lock someone up here!
Soko: You have to get confirmation from the council, or from a higher general in the west, at least!
Soko: This is insane!
Felcis: Well, yes < pseudo-scrolling
Felcis: Well, THAT'S HELNOVIA !!! < THIS IS HELNOVIEN <! \\. like "this is Sparta"
Felcis: Well, THAT'S HELNOVIA, as I've been told about it.
Felcis: Brigantia's land on your own initiative! Here people are still full of fresh ideas!
Felcis: Here, where this spoil of advice can't complain permanently thanks to the blockade of the Toras Mountains.
Felcis: If I had known that Korzojeno was currently under suspicion, I would not have dared to go here.
Felcis: Well, that's life. If you excuse me, I'll take a look around here ...
Soko: It's a strange coincidence that we suddenly meet such a person ...
Cibon: What do you think? Do you believe him that Korzojeno has nothing to do with this group, but Brigantia is behind it?
Soko: I can't imagine someone in the Council planning something like this ...
Kento: It is, of course, in the spirit of this Felcis to free the aristocracy from suspicion ...
Kento: From this point of view, it is quite possible that he will give us wrong facts ...
Cibon: Well, even if - does it make a difference for us? We're not in the Council here, we're in a prison.
Soko: Where you're right ...
---
Cibon: I can't believe it! How did you get such a portion together without really mining ore?
Felcis: Oh well. I played some ore carrier.
Felcis: Since I was mainly talking to people anyway, I offered to take the ore to the collection point for them.
Felcis: For just 10% deduction that went to me, people didn't have to drag the ore themselves.
Felcis: A surprising number of them have already responded to this. Above all these Pauamainer colleagues, for ore chopping is the meaning of life.
Kento: Not bad.
Cibon: Pah! Something like that is called scrounging! < scavenging
Felcis: But to something else. I need your help right away if possible.
Kento: what is it about?
Felcis: For our "plan" we need another item.
Felcis: I still had this item with me, fortunately the guards hadn't spotted it.
Felcis: I just had to spoil my luck with stupid clumsiness. I lost the thing.
Cibon: fool.
Felcis: Now this item is in the hands of a prisoner who is unwilling to give it back to me ...
Cibon: Oh, didn't you ask kindly enough?
Felcis: I could have asked as nicely as I wanted, the guy just has something against me or more about my background.
Soko: Please?
Felcis: We should just pay the guys a visit after dinner. Maybe we can do something more.
---
Felcis: Okay, it'll probably be a while before we get the stuff out of the mine.
Felcis: Well, the blasting was probably nothing today, but tomorrow is still a working day.
Felcis: In the meantime we can try to take our beautiful stone off this Robin ...
---
Felcis: Well, now that we have our powder, all we need is the stone.
Felcis: Our proletariat-protecting Grünhut is still watching over this at the moment. Time to free him of this burden.
Cibon: As soon as possible! I'm looking forward to it.
Soko: We mustn't take this fight carelessly, understand?
Kento: Yes, we should spare the Robin this extra pain.
Soko: Him - and you too.
---
Cibon: Right. I can well imagine how the guy interprets our hesitation ...
Kento: Well, if he underestimates us, that can only be an advantage.
Cibon: Our team name is Repsbrot troop. We are underestimated either way.
Soko: Good bread takes time to rise properly. Robin should be able to imagine that.
Felcis: You called yourself a Repsbrot troop? A truly delicious choice of names.
Cibon: Stop that!
Kento: Yes, as long as the stone is with Robin, anything can happen to it ...
Kento: What if he lost it, someone stole it, or the guards discovered it?
Felcis: I think this Robin knows how to protect his treasures. He has experience with it ...
Felcis: It looks like we have everything together. That means we can get started as soon as you are ready.
Felcis: We don't have to do it today, but we shouldn't wait too long either.
Felcis: As of today, I'll hang out here in the canteen every evening. Let me know when you're ready.
Kento: One more question, Felcis. We are now able to break the barrier, but what about the rest?
Kento: Just because the barrier is broken does not mean that we can walk out comfortably.
Felcis: You are absolutely right. However, I already have a plan for how to distract the guards.
Felcis: I'll tell you when we start the operation.
Felcis: Talk to me in the canteen when you're ready.
Kento: This Felcis really has its way of enlightening us at the last possible moment ...
Felcis: Well, we have everything together. Let me know when you're ready, I'm still waiting up here in the canteen.
Felcis: Don't take too much time.
---
Kento: If we really want to try out this tournament, the registration for it seems to be over there... <$
Felcis: This type is located on the top floor of the cell building. Shortly before the entrance to the terrace.
Kento: Alright. Let's have a look there.

Guard: Choose your next opponent.
Guard: Do you want to stop fighting?
Guard: Nagut.
Guard: Alright. Then prepare yourself briefly.

The result of today's tournament fights.
Saion: Hmpf! We'll win our tournament place back, just wait!
Jorn: I see many months of cruel battles coming on me. Someone get me out of here, please!
Saion: Jorn, will you please stop complaining all the time?
Saion: Gurim and I survive the whole thing without complaining! So get yourself together!
Jorn: We all know by now that you like to be beaten up, and that Gurim never complains as well!
Jorn: Nobody is forcing us to do all these fights, have you ever thought of it?
Jorn: Damn, by now I would even prefer to work regularly in the mine instead of performing in the tournament again!
Saion: I am doing my best here to create a good reputation for us here and to move us forward!
Saion: And everything you do is gripe, gripe, gripe! You should be grateful to me for pulling you along at all!
Jorn: GRATEFUL ?! It is YOUR fault that we ended up here in the first place! Just because you absolutely wanted your fight back then!
Jorn: And even here fighting is the only thing you can think of!
Saion: I've told you several times! This life is in our blood! We, with the last name Zinkar, never lose out!
Saion: But what am I wondering at all. Of course you don't understand that! You are the BLACK SHEEP of the three of us!
Jorn: Right! I am the black sheep!
Jorn: Right! I am the black sheep! LUCKILY!
Jorn: Otherwise I would have this
Jorn: Otherwise I would have this IDIOT BLOOD in me that everyone
Jorn: Otherwise I would have this IDIOT BLOOD in me, which TAKES ALL MIND and one for me
Jorn: Otherwise I would have this IDIOT BLOOD in me that TAKES ALL MIND and gives me a THICK SKULL!
Saion: WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ?! COME BACK IMMEDIATELY!
Cibon: W ... what was that now ...
Soko: Gurim ... What was Jorn talking about?
Gurim: ... It's been a little while since they had an argument ...
Gurim: Jorn ... is really just a half brother of us ... Is a complicated subject ...
Gurim: In any case, Saion doesn't manage to overlook this thing ...
Gurim: Excuse me, but I should make sure the two are right ...
Soko: ... It seems there is something more behind all the arguments ...
Kento: It's not that we have to play psychiatrists here. It is their business and we should not interfere.
Felcis: So my friend, we won, you know what that means? Bring the clunker.
Robin: Yes, yes. Alright. You were lucky this time. You can have your stone.
Robin: The next time we meet in the tournament, it won't be that easy for you!
Pauamainer Member: That was a top performance from you today! We haven't had such good opponents in a long time!
Pauamainer Member: Have a look at our base if you already belong to the Pauamainer underground brotherhood! We might have something for you.
Da Boss: Ei jòò, you really surprised me! You are tough guys!
Da Boss: Why not visit our Stidsepungd inside Grub! You can do a great job!
Cibon: What a dialect. Where does the guy come from? < What an accent. Where's this guy from?

Guard: passage only for registered combat participants.

Guard: If you want to participate in the tournament, register with my colleague at the table.

Guard: If you want to register for the tournament, please talk to me over the counter, yes?

Guard: In principle, prisoners can compete here in teams. There is a ranking list with the most successful teams at the top.
Guard: Each team can compete against another team a maximum of 2 times a day. You can only fight teams that are ranked below you or one or two ranks higher.
Guard: Should the team with the higher rank lose in a fight, it will decrease in rank behind the winner.
Guard: If the opponent with the lower rank loses again, nothing happens.
Guard: As far as equipment is concerned, you will be able to choose it, but you will find out more in the armaments room if you should fight.

Guardian: But you're pretty quick. Just arrived here and off to the arena. Well, your thing.
Guardian: I assume that the three of you want to compete as a team. In that case, I would need a team name.
Soko: How, a team name?
Guardian: This is common here. Don't think people want to remember your strange names. So come up with something.
Guardian: If I remember correctly, you were the force that cheated our country, right?
Guardian: How about "The Traitors"? With the name, most of you will know who it is!
Soko: Never!
Cibon: That would be even nicer!
Guardian: Beautiful, beautiful! Then think of something better. But don't let me wait too long or I'll write down my idea whether you like it or not.
Cibon: Come on, come up with something, buddy!
Kento: I don't know ...
Soko: Anything is better than this name ...
Kento: Um ...
Cibon: ... quick buddy!
Kento: Now, don't rush me!
Cibon: We don't have time.
Kento: "The Sunbread Squad".
Cibon: What the hell?
Kento: It comes from when you put me under pressure like this. Why doesn't anything come from your side? < That's what happens when you put me under pressure like this. Why don't you come up with something better?
Soko: "The Brigantine Pride"!
Cibon: Hm ...
Kento: I don't know, but the way it sounds, people will take it very ironically, Soko ...
Soko: ...
Cibon: I got it! We call ourselves after our destiny! The reason we're fighting for why we're going through all this stuff!
Soko: And that would be what? < And what would that be?
Cibon: "The Zinkar Butchers"!
Kento: ... Good ... That would at least clarify what we want to achieve ...
Guardian: Do you three have it slow? So you either tell me your team name, or your name is "The Traitors" and end. < and that's the end of it.
(Kento: Looks like I have to choose now.)
Kento: Our team name would then be "The Zinkar Butchers".
Guardian: Zinkar Butcher? So you want to overpower the Zinkar brothers? Then you still have a long way to go, because they are not that far down.
Cibon: Excuse me?
Guardian: In third place, to be exact.
Kento: Oha, that's surprising.
Cibon: This has to be changed urgently. What kind of tournament is that, where guys like this are up there?
Kento: Our team name would then be ... "The Sunbread Squad" ... < Our team name will be...
Guardian: Excuse me?
Kento: Sunbread, like the baked goods. "Meticulously baked to perfection using sunflour!"
Cibon: Buddy, you're not serious, are you? How should they take us with such a name seriously? < Kento, you gotta be kidding me! How are we supposed to be taken seriously with such a name?
Kento: If you don't take us seriously, you will underestimate us and that would be an advantage. < If they don't take us seriously, they'll underestimate us which would be an advantage.
Cibon: ... No! That would be absolutely stupid! < ...No! That'd be absolutely stupid!
Guardian: Whatever! If you want to be called Repsbrot troop, then you are called that. Registered < If you want to be called the Sunbread Squad, then we'll call you that.
Guardian: This would make you the first force in the history of this prison to name something edible. < This'll make you the first team in the history of this prison to be named after something edible.
Soko: Great class. < Wow. Great name you picked there.
Kento: I like reps bread ... < What? I like sunbread...
Kento: Our team name would then be "The Brigantine Pride".
Cibon: Um... are you sure about that Kento?
Soko: Let the people know that we behaved as soldiers of the Brigantine Order do!
Guard: Brigantine... Pride...?
Guardian: Wuahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! I've never seen anything like it!
Guardian: Brigantine Pride! And in a prison! A Brigantine prison of all places! Brigantia can definitely be proud of that, oh yeah they most certainly can!
Soko: ...Hey, we were wrongly locked up here!
Guardian: Haha, yep. That's what they all say.
Cibon: You made a great choice there, buddy ... < You made a great choice there... *eye roll*
Soko: I think it's good. It shows that you still believe in our innocence, Kento. < I think it's a good choice.
(Kento: I just found the self-irony of the name interesting, but I better not say anything ...) < (Kento: I mostly just found the irony of this name too good to pass up, but I better not say anything...)
Kento: I ... can't make up my mind. So we take "The Traitors". < I... just can't make up my mind. So we'll go with "The Traitors".
Soko: Kento! Why are you doing this?! Any other name would have been better, even Repsbrot troops!
Cibon: Yeah ... even Repsbrot troops ... okay maybe not, but damn, what about Zinkar butcher ?! < but still
Guardian: Ha, I knew it suited you. "The Traitors". Registered and connected. < suits you well ... Registered through and through!
Soko: No! We don't want that name!
Guardian: Do I look as if I would like to correct this entry again? The thing is done, so stop whining.
Kento: Sometimes it's best to just go with the river, Soko. < go with the flow
Kento: If people here think we're all traitors, a team name won't change that.
Soko: ... Still, you could have chosen something else ...
Guardian: Alright. Now that you are registered, you can start your first fight.
Guardian: Here is the ranking. If you want to fight, choose your opponent.
Guardian: You can only fight teams that are ranked below you or one or two ranks higher.

Guard: Here is tournament registration. What do you want?
Guard: Well, then please don't stand in the way here.
Guard: The tournament fights are closed for today. Do you want to see the current ranking?
Guard: Well, then please don't stand in the way here.
Guard: Click here for the tournament. How is it looking? Do you want to fight
Guard: Well, then please don't stand in the way here.
Guard: How? Not now? Please don't waste my time here.
Guard: So you want to fight "TournamentGegn1TurnierGegn2"? Well, then come in with you.
Cibon: What should we fight with?
Guard: Well, we have our armor room especially for tournament participants. Just go ahead, they'll explain how this works.

...

Kento: That ... was clever.
Felcis: With the other sack we repeat the game to complete the trail to the cell.
Felcis: Tonight we're going to trigger the effect and break the barrier. Then the escape starts!
Kento: Okay ... and then what do we do? Just because the barrier is gone, we can't just walk out!
Felcis: We won't either. At least not alone. We'll all walk out there together.
Soko: How, together? Do you mean ... the other prisoners?
Felcis: Exactly. Once the barrier is gone, we can easily break the cells. If we run away in masses, the guards are overwhelmed.
Felcis: This is the only way we can escape.
Soko: But ... we can't just release all the prisoners!
Felcis: I knew it was going to be complicated ... Look, Soko, there are times like this when you have to give your code of honor a vacation.
Felcis: We were illegally locked up here, we will only get out illegally.
Soko: You say that so nicely! We don't have the right to decide on something like that! Prisoners are prisoners!
Felcis: If so, why did you agree to the escape plan in the first place? We are prisoners too, forget?
Felcis: Anyway. There is no way back. We're escaping tonight. Until then, you should rest and prepare yourself internally.
Felcis: I hope I can count on your support ...
Kento: Wait! Is that really all? Do you think that's enough to get past the guards? I hope you are not serious!
Felcis: There's more to come. Let yourself be surprised.
Cibon: The guy really gets on my nerves! What is so difficult about speaking plain text ?!
Kento: I can understand that he wanted to hide this one detail ...
Soko: I knew something like this was coming.
Kento: He's right ... Without the turmoil, it will be much harder to get out of here.
Soko: I know ... But do we really have to go that far? How low do we want to sink?
Cibon: Soko please, let's not drop at the last moment!
Soko: Alright ... let's just get out of here ...

Insane Girl: Ah! There you are again! What was going on?
Insane Girl: Well, where did I stop ... Hmm ... Oh yeah!
Insane Girl: I feel like accompanying you in the future. It's okay, isn't it?
Kento: Uhhhm ... well ...
Cibon: buddy, RACE!
Cibon: ARE YOU MADNESS ?! Do you want us all to get on our nerves?
Kento: The ... The question came so suddenly and unexpectedly! I wasn't prepared for it ...
Blond girl: Oh, hello! What are you doing here Somehow everything is so dark and dark here, isn't it?
Cibon: No matter how gloomy and dark it may be here, the presence of your beauty alone makes any desolation go away!
Blond girl: wow! How long has it been since I got such a great compliment!
Blond girl: the people here are all so grumpy and in a bad mood, but you're totally different! Great!
Blond girl: I thought my life had only been going downhill since I landed here.
Blond girl: And only because of a little theft! < And all because
Insane Girl: I just wanted to help two other people who were totally desperate.
Insane Girl: completely stupid! And now I have to work here in this terrible mine! It is exhausting!
Cibon: J ... Yes ... Really hard times here ...
Insane Girl: Yes! Exactly! It's great to have someone you can tell everything about, really! Knew what's going on here
It's great to have someone you can tell everything about, really! Did you know what happened to me here yesterday? I sat on
that you can tell everything, really! Did you know what happened to me here yesterday? I was sitting at a table and suddenly came
really! Did you know what happened to me here yesterday? I was sitting at a table and suddenly these prisoners came and went

a table and suddenly these prisoners came and make fun of my ears! Totally mean, isn't it? I was the one
these prisoners and make fun of my ears! Totally mean, isn't it? I was depressed all evening, whole
funny about my ears! Totally mean, isn't it? I was depressed all evening, all alone in my cell ...

Depressed all evening, all alone in my cell ... My past was bad enough. I know my parents
alone in my cell ... My past was bad enough. I actually know my parents ...
Cibon: buddy! Let's get out of here!
Kento: ... insane. That you literally run away from a woman. What else I can experience.
Cibon: THERE ARE YOU WONDERFUL !? This brat would have cut my last nerves within the next 4 minutes!
Kento: Well, you have to admit. It was quite "entertaining".
Cibon: ... I want to have missed that ...

Man at the Counter: You have eaten enough for today. So it's not here!

Woman at the Counter: I'm sorry, there is no more reference.

Woman at the Counter: Here is no passage for you! Don't go too far or we'll call the guards!

Man at the Counter: Here is no passage for you! Don't go too far or we'll call the guards!

Felcis: Well? Are you ready?
Kento: Now we have your stone and the greyhound powder ... and still have no idea what your plan looks like. It's time for you to educate us.
Felcis: Well ... As I said before, I have to break the magic barrier - and this is possible with this stone and the gray-powdered powder.
Felcis: This protective barrier is maintained with a machine. It is near here, on the 1st floor of this building.
Felcis: All we have to do is bring this stone close to the machine to trigger its effect.
Soko: How do you trigger the effect? Through Signum?
Felcis: Exactly. The right spell and the bomb detonates.
Soko: But don't you have to be right next to the stone? How are we supposed to get so close to the machine with the stone?
Felcis: Well, that's where the greyhawk powder comes in!
Felcis: Greyhound powder enhances the effect of Signum sayings, but can also be used to extend the area of effect.
Felcis: And we do exactly that. With the help of the gray-sparkling powder we make a fuse from our cell to the stone at the machine.
Cibon: So so. Then how do you want to get the stone to the machine? Or pull the fuse? Really a great plan.
Felcis: So, well! Don't doubt here!
Felcis: In such situations, we at the nobility alliance always know how to help ourselves with the right trick!
Felcis: Ladies and gentlemen, two bags! Both full of sparkling dust, but only one with a magical stone.
Felcis: Dear lady, please hold this for a moment.
Soko: Um ... okay?
Felcis: We now provide the other sack, the one with the pebble inside, with a mystical aura ....
Felcis: And now the grand finale! See and be amazed!
Kento: Um ... Felcis? Where are you going?
Guard: So ... what kind of rubbish is that? A sack ... full of powder? Whatever it is, it no longer belongs to you!
Guard: Stop here, I'll just take it away.
Cibon: What the hell was that. Did you just have this one sack ... all our hope ...
Cibon: LOST TO THE GUARDIANS ?!
Cibon: It looks like this. What a pitty.
Cibon: Listen! You can not be serious?!
Felcis: Calm down, calm down, Cibon! Everything is going according to plan. What do you think where this bag is going now?
Soko: Probably in a camp ...
Felcis: Exactly! Now I know from a reliable source where exactly this camp is and now guess what is directly below it?
Cibon: ... The ... machine?
Felcis: Bingo!
Kento: And what about the fuse to the stone?
Felcis: Well, it's being laid right now.
Felcis: Alright, but don't take too much time.



-= 234 =-
Guard: Do you want an explanation of the choice of armor?
Guard: As you have probably already noticed, you will get some tournament coins from us.
Guard: You can exchange them here for armor pieces and other items that you can then use in combat.
Guard: You only choose your equipment once a day. You cannot change the equipment between fights. So plan well in advance if you want to fight several times.
Guard: Of course, you won't keep your armor or coins when your battles are over.
Guard: How? Did you decide differently? Then stop again from the beginning. Hurry up!
Guard: Then don't speak to me, but choose your armor and fight.

Guard: Oha, a new participant. Here you have your standard mine equipment and tournament coins.
Guard: Here are your tournament coins.
Guard: By the way, the number of your tournament coins depends on how much ore you have collected today.
Guard: You can now exchange your tournament coins for better equipment here if you think that the pickaxe and work clothes are not good enough for you.
Guard: If you have any questions about the choice of armor, feel free to ask me.
Guard: Do your selection quickly, don't keep the others waiting.

...

Guard: Get out when you're ready.

Guard: We have a very nice collection of equipment here, don't we? Would also be boring if you would only fight with picks all the time.

Guard: Are you ready for the battle?

Guard: Hey, what's this about? Do you want to lose out now? Once in there is no going back. You fight now whether you like it or not!



-= 240 =-

Felcis: Come on. We wanted to pay a visit to that one person, right?
Felcis: We have to go up one more floor. He's there by the corridor to the roof.
---$
Guard: Do you want to go back to your cells? You still have some time left.
Guard: You there! Halt!
Guard: You're coming with us!
Soko: Why? What's happening?
Guard: NO QUESTIONS! Get over here!
---$
Guard: Hey there, stop!
Guard: You there with the glasses. You're coming with us.
Felcis: Why might that be? Is it about my excellent performance in the mine?
Guard: No talking, come along!
Felcis: Okay, okay.
Kento: He's probably going to get interrogated...
Cibon: He has my sympathy.
---$
Guard: Enjoy your free time then.

...

$
Cibon: Kento! What did they do to you?
Kento: Interrogated. They wanted to squeeze information out of me.
Cibon: What did you tell them?
Kento: Mostly stuff I made up. I'll tell you more about it tomorrow. It's very important that what we say is identical.
Kento: How is Soko doing?
Cibon: I think she's feeling better now, right?
Soko: ...Yeah... It was just a punch.
Cibon: Those guys really don't have mercy on anyone.
Soko: Why would they anyway? I'm as much of a spy as you two are.
Soko: By the way, Kento... Are you sure lying to them is a good idea?
Soko: After this, nobody will believe in our innocence anymore...
Kento: Trust me, there's no other way around it.
Kento: This is a kangaroo court. They use us as laborers and sources of information. They aren't interested in our innocence.

$
Guard: EVERYONE WAKE UP IMMEDIATELY AND GET OUT OF YOUR CELLS!
Cibon: *yawn* Yet another day with tough work ahead...
Soko: ...Why... already? ...Is it already time to get up...?
Cibon: Hey Kento! Wake up! You can't sleep here, remember?
Kento: W... What?
Cibon: Prison. Mining.
Kento: Not again...

Soko: So far, they haven't picked us up for questioning.
Cibon: Maybe you skip it today ...
Cibon: Would have been too nice ...
Guard: You there with the blue headband! Come along.
Cibon: Looks like it's my turn today ...
Cibon: Yes! You want information from me? I'll give you some!
Kento: Why do I have a very bad feeling about this ...

Soko: I hope Cibon survives the interrogation ...
Kento: I have my concerns ...
Kento: Oh yes, Soko. What I wanted to ask you for a while, why did you join the brigand order?
Soko: Are you interested in that?
Kento: You take the role of us soldiers quite seriously, and to an extent that I'm not used to from other colleagues.
Kento: I'm just wondering why. That's why I'm interested ...
Soko: There's not that much there. I wanted to follow in my mother's footsteps, that's all.
Kento: Your mother was already a soldier?
Soko: Yes, it was. She was mainly on guard duty.
Soko: I was often with her at the time and watched her at work because no one else was at home.
Kento: So you had no siblings? And your father?
Soko: My father worked in the mine.
Kento: In the ... mine?
Soko: Not this one. I come from Ferrolholm, at the western end of Tora.
Soko: But don't think I have more to do with mine work than you or Cibon.
Soko: I detest mine work, I detest mine workers ...
Kento: W ... Why is that please?
Soko: Kento, you also don't tell anyone why you hate your father, so why should I tell you more?
Kento: How was it?
Cibon: S ... don't you see that?
Cibon: This ... guy ... is really ... fast to 180, I tell you ...

$
Guard: EVERYONE GET OUT OF YOUR CELLS AND WAKE UP IMMEDIATELY! Wait... THE OTHER WAY AROUND!
Soko: Wake up... Wake up... Okay. Wake up! Now!
Soko: I did it...
Cibon: Mornin' Soko. Already up?
Cibon: Kento! Wake up!
Kento: No... Must... have... more... sleep...
Cibon: Prison. Mining.
Kento: Not agaaaain...

Guard: So it's your turn today. Come along.
Cibon: It's not what we have to get through here just because this old sack tells this crap!
Cibon: Of course we are spies! Spies who wanted to help the border guards find this troop!
Cibon: Fake band of robbers ?! This is not a laugh !! How can they believe that crap!
Kento: Cibon, the thing has been eaten for a long time. Mr. Uroto is a council member. It's better not to question his word so quickly.
Cibon: Whatever!
Cibon: An innocent woman is being beaten for questioning because of someone like that, I mean ...
Guard: Quiet over there! It's bedtime!
Guard: Tomorrow at 5:00 a.m. the mine will go. So it's better not to stay awake too long. We will come back to you soon.
Felcis: Tsk. Don't stay awake. No problem, I'm the calm myself, in this situation.
Kento: Who's over there?
Felcis: Is it even allowed to talk here?
Kento: Yes, as long as it's not too loud ...
Felcis: Felcis is my name ... Felcis Kiorta. Envoy from the aristocracy and thus obviously a serious criminal in this country.
Cibon: M ... wait ... Envoy from the aristocracy? The Farenian aristocracy?
Felcis: Exactly this, my boy. Can I get your names too?
Kento: Kento ...
Cibon: And I'm Cibon ... you may have heard of these traitors?
Cibon: Former soldiers of the brigand order, now spies on behalf of Korzojeno?
Felcis: Spies? What are you talking about I'm sorry, but I haven't seen much of the world in the last few days ...
Kento: What is such a person doing here? Why were you ... were you locked up?
Felcis: You can save yourself the formalities. Apparently I'm no more than a mine worker here like everyone else.
Felcis: So yes ... why was I locked up? To be honest, I ask myself the same thing.
Felcis: All I wanted was some support from the brigand order soldiers here.
Felcis: Instead, I was locked up here. Because I come from Korzojeno, or rather the Farenian aristocracy.
Felcis: People of my kind have been in high demand here lately. Apparently we know something I don't know about myself.
Kento: So you didn't notice what was going on at the border recently?
Felcis: No. Can you enlighten me

Felcis: Do I understand that correctly? YOU are spies who work for Korzojeno or the Farenian aristocracy? Here in Brigantia?
Kento: More specifically, we are spies from this troop from the Silvan Forest that you think is related to Korzojeno.
Felcis: Yes, of course. As soon as something bad happens across the border, it is the Farenian nobility.
Felcis: It seems that trust between us neighboring countries has not improved noticeably since the war.
Felcis: For the record: I don't know anything about any underground military organization. How crazy do they think we are?
Felcis: The war was a lesson to us. We would not dare to mess with Brigantia again.
Cibon: Is that so? However, we saw this group with our own eyes! We were prisoners of them!
Felcis: Yes, I don't want to doubt that either, but the Farenian aristocratic society knows nothing about it.
Felcis: I think it would be more conceivable that this group works for Brigantia itself.
Cibon: Excuse me? What sense does that make?
Felcis: It's very simple. Brigantia has this oh so democratic form of government, your advice.
Felcis: Well, suppose we have a few council members who are interested in taking some more from Korzojeno.
Felcis: But then you have the problem that the majority of the council members are more for peaceful coexistence.
Felcis: So how do you get an official permit to march into Korzojeno and dust off properly? Now?
Kento: ... You pretend that Korzojeno poses a threat by forming such a force ...
Felcis: Right! We have a smart head here.
Cibon: W ... What the hell! Why should the government be playing the wrong game?
Felcis: Oh, there's a lot of wrong play in the high ranks, believe me. < foul play
Cibon: But why then does a Brigantia councilor come up with the idea of locking us in because of such a force?
Cibon: If what you say is true, it is quite possible that Mr. Uroto himself was involved in the matter!
Felcis: Well, maybe you saw something that would blow it up.
Felcis: Some evidence that this troop is hired by Brigantia ...
Cibon: We have no such evidence! We didn't see anything! Isn't it buddy?
Cibon: ... buddy?
Kento: No ... not really.
Kento: Soko? Is everything ok?
Soko: It's okay ... W ... Who are you?
Cibon: Wait ... you're in the same cell ?!
Felcis: Kyorta my name, Felcis Kyorta. And with what pretty lady am I honored here?
Soko: Another one of this kind ... < Another one of *those* people...
Felcis: What type are you talking about?
Cibon: Yes, what kind? And hey, what about the formalities, Felcis?
Kento: It can be a long evening ... < It's going to be a long night...

$
Guard: EVERYONE GET OUT OF YOUR FEATHERED BEDS IMMEDIATELY! IT'S TIME TO WORK!
Cibon: ...Ugh... Damn! We have to get up again?
Felcis: What "feathers" is this guard talking about?
Felcis: I didn't notice a single feather... in this so-called "bed".
Soko: Okay... Wake up, now, immediately. And get up!
Soko: Ha, I did it again.
Cibon: K... Kento. We have to get up. Same as before.
Cibon: Prison. Mining.
Kento: Not again...
Felcis: Would it be alright if you showed me the way to the mine? After all, I'm new here.
Soko: Sure, you can come with us. We're all going the same way regardless.
Cibon: Yeah, for my own sake too...
(Cibon: Heh, glasses.)
Felcis joins your party as a guest.

Guard: Don't you dare show up here so late again! If we say you should go to the cells, then you do it immediately!
Soko: You're a little late.
Felcis: Well, yes. This prison is so big and one cell is like the other. I think I got lost a bit.
Felcis: Well, I think the four of us already know what we have in common, right?
Cibon: What should I have in common with you?
Kento: I know something there.
Felcis: I'm talking about the fact that all four of us have been wrongly locked up here.
Soko: So you believe in our innocence?
Felcis: Of course. You trust me too, don't you?
Soko: ... Yes, of course.
Cibon: Believe it or not, what are you getting at?
Felcis: If the dear guards don't want to treat us according to our innocence, I think we should help.
Felcis: I'm talking about an outbreak plan.
Soko: M ... Are you serious? After all, we are here in Helnovien. You know how the security measures are here.
Felcis: Please come as close as possible and speak quietly. We don't want to be heard after all ...
Felcis: I know Helnovien, I know this building very well. As you know, this was formerly the area of Korzojeno.
Felcis: And the former castle of Helnovien has been standing for a good bit longer than 10 years.
Felcis: Even the magic barrier that makes this castle so powerful came from us.
Felcis: Brigantia stole all of this in the war - sorry - "conquered".
Felcis: And the outstanding security of this prison is mainly due to our great barrier.
Felcis: Indeed, it's so great that the guards can rely on it completely. At least they think so.
Felcis: But now imagine if you could remove this barrier.
Felcis: Check out these grilles here, especially the locks. Do you think this looks stable?
Kento: Well ... I've seen more stable ones, that's true.
Felcis: If this barrier weren't, a Signum expert could melt these locks in a matter of minutes.
Felcis: What I want to say, if we can remove the barrier, we can escape.
Felcis: And I know how to remove this barrier.
Soko: W ... how?
Felcis: I want to have your word first. You're going to join in, aren't you?
Kento: I still have my doubts ... Even if we break the barrier, we will have enough other problems ...
Felcis: Yes, where you are right. But I already have a plan in mind ...
Felcis: I think it would be best if we all slept over it one more night.
Felcis: I'll tell you more tomorrow if you decide to take part.
Cibon: I notice ... none of us were questioned today, right?
Soko: That's right ... maybe you've already given it up?
Kento: Either that, or this Sir Dolaros needed a break.
(Felcis: ... Sir Dolaros ...)
(Felcis: Sir Avaron's guinea pig. I was missing that now.)

$
Guard: EVERYONE WAKE UP IMMEDIATELY! THE MINE IS WAITING!
Soko: Alright! I'm up! Haha! I'm getting used to it already.
Cibon: Mornin' Soko. <# character error
Felcis: This barbaric time... Why can't the entire world just get up three hours later?
Cibon: Kento. Wake up. Mining. Prison.
Kento: Not again...
Felcis: So? What'll it be? Are you joining me?
Kento: J... Join?
Cibon: Better to ask him again when we're at the front of the mine. He's usually a bit more awake then. <# another character error

Felcis: This senseless theater is finally over ...
Cibon: So? How many did he thunder you in? < How many did he hammer into you this time?
Felcis: Excuse me?
Cibon: Beaten. He hit you, didn't he?
Felcis: Hm ... I guess he was aware of how allergic Farenia is when you do something bad to his people.
Felcis: An act of violence of this kind could have had strong diplomatic consequences.
Kento: Does that mean Farenia is made an enemy if you are beaten?
Felcis: Something like that. That is, that is the general belief among people.
Felcis: Unfortunately Farenia doesn't play this guardian angel for all of its members ...

$
Guard: EVERYONE WAKE UP IMMEDIATELY! THE MINE IS WAITING!
Cibon: Kento. Wake up. Mining. Prison.
Kento: Not again...

Guard: Well? Mining ore like you should? Then get back to your cells.
Guard: What? You want to go through here? Why of course, to the mine without any equipment whatsoever, so that you can have an excuse to not have to work? Keep dreaming.

$
Guard: I hope you submitted all of your equipment too.
Guard: If we notice that you still have something else, be prepared to feel what a vein of ore feels when you take a swing at it.
Guard: You should go to the building left of here. You can get your equipment there.

$
Guard: We're going to continue blocking the way through here so that people like you don't pass.

...

$
Cibon: Here we go! Onward, to the mine! As we embark on a mission to hunt for ore that awaits us!
Soko: Just shut up already!
Cibon: Well now, someone isn't in a good mood today...
Soko: Not in a good mood? Of course I wouldn't be!
Soko: I just spent a terrible night on a thing that can hardly be called a bed!
Soko: And then this inhuman time as well as having to work in the mine! Who wouldn't be in a bad mood, dammit!
Soko: So please...
Soko: ...be...
Soko: ...QUIET!
Cibon: Kento, I don't think Soko has ever been woken up by anyone before, especially with how early she always gets up. So what do you think?
Cibon: Must be quite the shock to her!
Soko: BE QUIET!
Kento: ...I still have a headache. Please, not right now...
Cibon: Oh man, what a way to start the day off.

$
Cibon: We should go to a different area this time, Kento! Working in the same place is boring.
Kento: Huh... Is that so?
Soko: This motivation just defies all logic...
Cibon: In a bad mood again?

$
Cibon: Okay! The mine's quite the place to explore, so where are we headed this time?
Soko: Probably where the junctions lead us to.
Soko: Kento doesn't look like he'll be awake enough to swing at those switches with his pickaxe anytime soon.
Kento: W... What? Yesterday, the switches led us to a different area...
Cibon: Yes! Soko's back to being cheerful again. Now it's all back to normal.
Kento: Just great...

$
Cibon: And another day of working in the mine...
Soko: What's wrong? You seem less excited than you were in the past few days.
Felcis: I think Cibon and I were up "discussing" a little too late last night, right?
Cibon: Yeah yeah, whatever. Off to the mine! Let's go, Kento!
Kento: Okaaaay... *yawn*
Felcis: You have a sleepy friend there.

Felcis: So what'll it be? Are you joining me?
Kento: Where do I join?
Felcis: You don't remember our conversation last night?
Kento: Oh... Just a moment... Yeah, I remember.
Kento: I'll join as long as I can sleep in again, if I ever do...
Felcis: Watch what you say. We aren't the only ones around here.
Felcis: Come over to the side.
Felcis: So can I trust you on this?
Cibon: You can count on me.
Soko: Yeah...
Felcis: Alright.
Felcis: To break the "thing", I will need certain things that are likely to be found in the mine. <\/
Felcis: I don't yet know where we can find that in the mine. What is certain is that we have to smuggle the stuff out of the mine.
Felcis: For this to work, we will need a good reputation with the guards so that we are not under too much suspicion.
Felcis: So you know what to do?
Cibon: Yeah! We have to do good mining!
Felcis: Exactly. And since I would only stop you from doing this, we will go our separate ways this time. I will collect information.
Soko: Alright, but be careful not to expose it.
Felcis: It is in my interest and I hope so with you. Not a word of it goes to anyone. No matter whom, understood?
Cibon: I guess we could imagine that much.
Felcis: Alright. Then happy work in the mine!
Cibon: A smart way to get out of the way of work.
Kento: Well, he will hardly be able to outsmart the ore collector. He'll probably get little food today.
Soko: Your thoughts have turned astonishingly recently around the topic of food, Kento.
Cibon: What a coincidence. </\

Felcis: Remember: we have to do a good job so that we are given dynamite to blow up.
Felcis: As soon as we have the dynamite, I'll tell you where to go.
---
Felcis: Now we have our dynamite, but still not the stuff we need.
Felcis: Come on, finding the stuff can't be that hard.
Felcis: We have our powder, from this point of view there is hardly anything left that is worth going into the mine ...
Kento: It's not that we have a choice.
Felcis: Oh damn, that's right. We are prisoners. Thank you for reminding me of it.
Cibon: Maybe there are other interesting things down there that we can smuggle out.
Felcis: Better not take any chances.
Soko: Oh dear ... how long do we have to go through this ordeal?
Felcis: Guys, it's time we got out of here. The longer we wait here, the less certain is the future of my people.
Felcis: I also can't see this mine work anymore! Really!
Soko: Your first argument sounded clearly selfless.

...

Felcis: Well, now we have been promoted to mine work with an explosive charge!
Felcis: The wall that we want to blow up is at one point along the tracks.
Felcis: Just make sure that we turn right at the first junction. The next up then, alright?
Kento: I'll try ...
---?
Felcis: Okay, last time it somehow didn't quite work out. Then stop again.
Felcis: At the first turn right, at the second straight up.
Felcis: So this time not sleeping so much while driving, okay Kento?
Kento: Hey, it's not like I'm sleeping ...

$
Kento: Closing time... Good, I'm almost starving. Let's get to the cafe soon...

$
Soko: Finally... It's over...
Cibon: Then let's go to the canteen!
Kento: Yaaay!

$
Kento: Open the gates to the canteen, we're on our way!
Soko: The gates have probably been open for a while now...

$
Felcis: It was very exhausting indeed. So where do we eat?
Cibon: Don't act like that. You mined the least amount out of all of us!
Felcis: But the amount of effort I put in probably also determines how much I get to eat.
Kento: Come now, I think we all want something to eat, right? Let's get going.

Felcis: Ah, there you are at last. And how did the day go?
Cibon: The way a mine day works if you work hard. But you probably don't know anything like that.
Felcis: Oh, I was very busy today. What do you think I found out today?
Felcis: Just come down ...
Felcis: Let's do it classic. I have good news and bad news.
Felcis: First the good one. I know where we can get our stuff.
Felcis: And now the bad one: we need dynamite!
Soko: dynamite ?!
Felcis: Mine workers get that, if they do a particularly good job, I've heard.
Felcis: So you're going to have to keep going.
Cibon: Pff. If it's nothing else.
Felcis: I suggest we go to the canteen first and then continue talking after dinner.
Cibon: Ha, for you slackers there won't be much food anyway!
Felcis: Diet, my friend, diet ...

Pauamainer Member: YOU HAVE COLLECTED ALL 8 MINE ORDERS!
Pauamainer Member: YOU HAVE COLLECTED ALL 8 MINE ORDERS! I AM OFFICIALLY MEMBERS OF THE PAUAMAIN SUB-BROTHERHOOD!
Pauamainer Member: YOU HAVE COLLECTED ALL 8 MINE ORDERS! THEREFORE I AM OFFICIALLY MEMBERS OF THE PAUAMAIN SUB-BROTHERHOOD! WELCOME!

Pauamainer Member: YOU MAY HAPPEN!
Pauamainer Member: If you want to become a member, BRING ME 8 MINES ORDER !!
Kento: Mine Order? Um ... And where do you get them from?
Pauamainer Member: 8 PAUAMAINER MEMBERS, who work in the far corners of the mine, will award you the medals when you reach them !!!
Soko: Does the guy always have to scream so loud?
Cibon: Do you really think the guy can talk normally?

Pauamainer Member: VISIT US SOON!
Pauamainer Member: HELLO BROTHERS! YOU MUST HAPPEN!

Prisoner: We are staring with particular interest at the wall that you are currently able to cover. Get out of here.

Felcis: Hello you, I'm back because of the pebble ...
Prisoner: I already told you that you won't get it again. We will definitely not give anything to a blue-blooded pack like you! You know our motto! < robber barons / smells of nobility / silver platter
Felcis: Yes, we all know it. We all don't want to hear it again ...
Prisoner: WE STEAL FROM THE RICH AND GIVE IT TO THE POOR! We bring justice to this corrupt world, oh yes we do!
Cibon: What the hell?
Felcis: I would like to remind you that you are in a prison here and you can hardly do anything with this motto.
Prisoner: Why? I see a wonderful start for this right now! YOU are nobility, you are rich. WE are poor! So we keep your clunker, it's that simple!
Soko: You're not quite right on the head? You think your theft is fair because of such a status question? I'm not laughing!
Prisoner: But hello! We have a pretty lady here. May I introduce myself? Robin Llewlynus my name.
Soko: Soko Filaja. What ever. Now what about this stone?
Robin: I would love to give it to you if I didn't know you were hanging out with this screwed up bigwig!
Felcis: The colored peacock from Farenia - there is no property here in prison!
Felcis: Apart from that, your motto is just a farce anyway, so that you don't bear the anger of the small population on you.
Felcis: Don't think I haven't heard from you before. You divide the property? Certainly.
Felcis: That explains, above all, all the riches that were found in your base when you were caught.
Felcis: You may give a coin from the treasure chest to the local farmers, they don't have to know what you have.
Robin: You can tell your stories!
Kento: But not a bad idea in itself. So you get support from the people there when you need it.
Cibon: Haha, what weaklings! They probably used the peasants to hide from the soldiers.
Robin: Now don't get wrong thoughts! If you only knew which aristocratic troops we all attacked and robbed! They all had their escorts.
Cibon: Yes, yes, there is a lot to tell. I bet even we three new additions to the Brigant Order could easily sweep you away!
Cibon: In a tournament fight, for example.
Cibon: Yes, yes, there is a lot to tell. You can't even take on three new members of the Brigade Order with us!
Cibon: You remember the tournament fight, don't you?
Robin: Oh yes? Try it! You can see where we are in the tournament, the "Avengers of the Just"! I bet you won't be able to defeat any of the three of us!
Robin: Oh yes? Don't imagine anything just because you were last successful! We just held back! We can finish you anytime, we bet?
Felcis: With the stone, I assume? You don't have much else.
Robin: How? Stone? Moment!
Felcis: Your commitment. We bet on the stone. If our 3 ex-soldiers win here, we'll get him, otherwise you'll keep him.
Robin: Ha! You dream of that! We don't get involved in something like that.
Cibon: How? Are you suddenly afraid that you could lose against us?
Robin: Ha ... Ha! You would like that! Okay, we'll go over the bet. Under one condition!
Robin: Should WE - as is to be expected - win, we will keep the stone AND your pretty friend here will "come and visit" us in the evening after work.
Soko: W..W..W..W ..
Soko: W..W..W..W..HOW PLEASE ?!
Cibon: Ah ... Ahahahahahahahahahahah! Are you sure about that?
Felcis: Alright! The bet counts!
Soko: W ... WHAT?!?! Are you still whole ...
Kento: Please, Soko ... just hold back a little ...
Felcis: That would probably settle everything. See you in the arena!
Robin: Haha, with joy!
Soko: SAY, ARE YOU STILL TIGHT?!?!
Felcis: Woha! What a temper, weird!
Soko: You also have every reason to be afraid.
Felcis: Calm down, Soko, calm down! Everything will be fine! Trust me...
Soko: How should everything go well here? What happens if we lose ?!
Cibon: Come on Soko, we won't lose against them! You'll probably take care of that yourself ...
Felcis: I'm sorry, but I saw in this bet the only way to get this stone back ...
Felcis: Who knows if we would have gotten this far again if we had refused because of you ...
Kento: G ... Exactly ... Besides ... even if we lose, all they're going to get is a lot of ... pain ...
Cibon: You say it, buddy!
Soko: How? Ah...
Soko: Sorry Kento, but I just couldn't hold it back ...
Soko: Alright. We just won't lose. Everything will be fine...
Kento: By the way, Felcis, what kind of stone is that anyway?
Felcis: This stone contains special Signum powers. No powers with which they would know what to do ...
Felcis: But for us this stone is absolutely necessary. Without this, we will not be able to break the barrier.
Felcis: But please don't tell anyone about it. The thing should remain nothing more than a beautiful sparkling stone.
Cibon: Banged! Then we should watch that we turn this Eumel into a snail in the tournament!
Soko: Yes and woe if not! I hope you remember who you share your cell with, Felcis!

Robin: We'll see you in the tournament then, haha!

Robin: Now you have your clunker again, I hope you are satisfied! But just wait! You rich bags will experience your downfall sooner or later!
Felcis: Ignore it. Simply ignore...

Prisoner: We give it to the poor because they really need it, oh yes we do!

Prisoner: We steal from the rich to make them less rich, oh yes we do!

Saion: You again. We'll see each other again in the tournament, just wait!
Soko: What's going on between you? You should talk about your problems instead of ...
Saion: Our problems? What is it that interests you? Take care of your own stuff!
Kento: Come on Soko, better leave it ...
Saion: Pah! The fact that you hit again means nothing! I demand revenge!
Jorn: Rule number one of the Zinkar brothers: We never learn our lesson!
Saion: Jorn, you kindly keep your cheeky mouth!
Saion: Ha! The Zinkar butchers are progressing, it seems. You will be surprised who slaughters whom!
Jorn: Your name is on the agenda!
Saion: Shut up, Jorn!
Saion: Place \ v [1886] are you already now? Not long now and our fight is imminent! Oh yeah!
Jorn: Oh joy.
Saion: Do you see? Even this stubborn redhead from brother is looking forward to this fight!
Jorn: Stubborn brother? Someone must have stuck a mirror to me somewhere.
Saion: What does that mean again ?!
Saion: Oh hello! There are the "Zinkar butchers"! Pretty self-confident when choosing a name, I just say!
Jorn: I already feel like fresh meat. < to be sliced
Saion: Quiet, Jorn! You always with your pessimistic manner.
Saion: Ha! And? What rank do you have now? We are all waiting impatiently for your challenge!
Jorn: Are we doing this?
Saion: We'll prove we can take on brigand order soldiers!
Jorn: You can just attack a couple of guards if you want to prove it.
Saion: Be quiet, Jorn!

Jorn: ... please leave me in peace, yes?
Jorn: I hope you had fun. You can try to fight these Pauamainers. They are really violent.
Jorn: I have to know, as often as Saion has taken on us ... And her boss is beyond our borders anyway ...
Saion: This is so typical of you again! Just howling and whining!
Jorn: After half a dozen defeats against this guy, I have every reason to do so!
Jorn: It looks like it will soon be a "slaughter festival". And I thought that ambition would only have this blue-haired mischief from brother.
Jorn: Well, wonderful, you are getting closer and closer to our place. You really mean it, don't you?
Cibon: Come on, it's just a tournament fight. And your brother didn't want it any other way.
Jorn: Yes, but I'm being dragged into this mess. Nobody asks me!
Soko: Believe me, on our side it's not necessarily that different.
Cibon: How, where, what? You never really complained, Soko!
Soko: So what? That doesn't mean that I like the stuff.
Jorn: Hey, I think we understand each other then.
Jorn: Come on, Soko, we're making a pact! We both will just go on strike and do nothing during the fight!
Soko: Sounds interesting.
Cibon: Now don't get stupid thoughts!
Jorn: Zinkar Butcher ... Very great name choice. Now I can't sleep peacefully during the night.
Saion: You're such a scaredy bunny! What does a name mean? You can see how far we've come!
Jorn: What? Fear is such a wonderful thing. It keeps you from doing stupid things.
Jorn: And some people here could really use a little more fear ...
Jorn: You really don't have to hurry with this tournament story.
Jorn: I'm really happy if my brother can't find an opponent to fight for a day ...
Soko: May I ask why you are doing everything your brother imposes on you?
Soko: You don't seem to agree very often ...
Jorn: Well ... um ... we're brothers?
Jorn: It's not that I know people I could go to when I leave my brothers.
Jorn: Besides, you can't imagine what kind of theater Saion would do in this case ...
Saion: What are you talking about over there?
Jorn: We are currently discussing whether your actions are due to a lack of intelligence or a mental disorder.
Saion: What the ... I act exactly as we have to act as a gang of thieves!
Jorn: Yes, you could really discuss the topic for a long time.

Gurim: ...
Gurim: Congratulations on your victory.
Cibon: Thank you, you fought well too.
Gurim: We'll see you in the tournament ...
Cibon: I'm curious to see if your fighting style has improved with this strange weapon.
Kento: Speaking of weird weapons. Are you still struggling with this filled pouch, Jorn?
Jorn: The one? No way! We wouldn't have enough items to fill it with a solid weight.
Kento: What are you fighting with?
Jorn: Well ... you'll see ...
Gurim: Hello ...
Soko: You are really a welcome change compared to your talkative brothers.
Gurim: D ... thank you ...

Pauamainer Member: Ah, a new member, I see! Great! We are happy about every enthusiastic mine worker! Good luck for!
Pauamainer Member: Have you been to my colleague over there? If you are new here, you will receive a small gift from us.
Pauamainer Member: Have you ever noticed that the rails in the end area with the many cliffs actually go on?
Pauamainer Member: There used to be a large mine area from which we were totally separated due to an earthquake!
Pauamainer Member: What do you think, how much ore was there ?! A mess, really.

Kento: Hmph... It's stuck here.

Pauamainer Member: Ah, I see! So you collected all the medals and were able to get in here? Congratulation! You are now officially a member of the Pauamainer underground brotherhood.
Pauamainer Member: We have a gift for newbies like you. Come on, go through and get it.
Pauamainer Member: I hope you have done enough good work so that the guards let you go through this find when you leave!
Pauamainer Member: Since we are guards here, we stay in the mine a little longer until all the people are really gone. Yes, we can. You'd better go back now.

Kento: Hmph... It's stuck here.

Pauamainer Member: Here is the area of the Pauamainer veterans! For years we have been at the top of the battle tournament ranking! Only our boss can outdo us.
Pauamainer Member: And you can see that again: only those who work hard in the mine can get far in the tournament!
Pauamainer Member: Those who work hard in the mine train their body and mind! This is better than any combat training !!
Kento: Um ... yes ... Sure ...
Pauamainer Member: Hey, it's closing time. Don't think we're getting out of here because of something like that. We don't go here before you forget it. So go ahead, go back.
Pauamainer Member: Oh! So you are the colleagues who beat us in the tournament! It was a great fight.
Pauamainer Member: In this way we were able to recognize our weaknesses and can now improve further!
Pauamainer Member: There, take the item out of the chest as a token of our gratitude.
Pauamainer Member: At some point we will see each other again in the tournament!

Pauamainer Member: That was really a good fight! It was almost even better than finding a new, untouched ore site!

Pauamainer Member: Great performance in the tournament.

Kento: Hmph... It's stuck here.
