Prisoner: Sometimes, I have this feeling that better equipment in the tournament brings you more than your ability to fight does.
Prisoner: How else can you explain to me that these Pauamainer Veterans are always up there? Of course, it's because they dig up a lot of ore and get a lot of tournament coins in turn!
Prisoner: And a lot of tournament coins mean better equipment, as you probably already know.

...

$
Prisoner: I feel sorry for "The Slimealgamation". They've got it rough, being constantly being beaten up by newcomers.
Prisoner: There are even some low-ranking teams that have the audacity to beat them up again and again, despite being ranked above them! Just out of frustration that they themselves can't get anywhere!
Prisoner: If you ask me, I'm happy every time "The Slimealgamation" wins, even if it happens very rarely!

$
Prisoner: I'm curious to see who'll make it through this time.

$
Old Prisoner: It's always good to see that there are prisoners who are brave enough to stand up against "The Terror from Below". They're the very monsters that haunt us down in the mine.
Old Prisoner: So you can always hope that you might get help down there if you're really being chased by something like that.
Old Prisoner: In broad daylight, these beings look much less dangerous anyway!

$
Prisoner: The Exotics are my personal favorite here! They have such an intriguing fighting style.
Prisoner: In the beginning, it doesn't seem like they're up to the task and that the opponent will win, but after a few rounds, they really get going!
Prisoner: So many opponents have already fallen for their tactic!

$
Prisoner: These Avengers of the Just are a strange group. They're constantly talking about their "righteous redistribution of property".
Prisoner: These guys are in Helnovien. There isn't much to redistribute. Ever since the war, there've only been a bunch of poor people with very few exceptions.
Prisoner: But their archer has what it takes, you have to give them that. I've rarely seen so many arrows fly at once!

$
Prisoner: It doesn't happen very often that "The Boss" is challenged, but when he is, it's always quite the battle to watch.
Prisoner: The Boss fights alone, and so far, has easily taken on any group that tried to bring him down.
Prisoner: Too bad the Pauamainer Veterans have since given up trying to dethrone him from 1st place.
Prisoner: But those newcomers, the Zinkar Brothers, have been trying their hand at it lately. They're really bringing a breath of fresh air to this tournament!

$
Prisoner: These Shadow Crawlers are a group that I really don't want to run into late at night. They're scary and cruel enough during the day!
Prisoner: And if they do their foggy clothing on themselves, their opponent sees them as badly as if it were actually night.

$
Prisoner: Hehe! The fights so far have been pretty great! It's always worth being here.
Prisoner: When is it finally starting? I don't want to wait any longer...
Kento: What kind of area is this? And what are all these people doing here?
Prisoner: You don't know? Here is where the tournament battles take place. They happen almost every day. Any prisoner can participate.
Soko: But what do you get from it?
Prisoner: Fame and recognition. People who do well at the tournament are treated with more respect by the other prisoners.
Prisoner: At the same time, it brings entertainment for all the other prisoners watching.
Prisoner: I heard that before the tournament was introduced, there were significantly more uprisings and problems with prisoners.

$
Prisoner: These tournament battles are really pretty much the only fun thing we have left in this prison.
Prisoner: Fortunately, there are enough volunteers who actually want to knock themselves out at the end of the day...

$
Guard: Prisoners have no business here!

...

$
Prisoner: As you can see over there, plenty of guards also watch these tournament battles.
Prisoner: Some of us are really starting to wonder if they introduced the tournament mainly for their own entertainment...

$
Prisoner: Pretty good view from here, right? But I wouldn't dare to get too close to the rails. We've had cases where prisoners fell down from here...

$
Prisoner: If the boss decides to fight, you have to stay up here! If he uses his secret attack, you'll still be able to feel the wind even up here!

$
Prisoner: This guy here looks like a noble. How'd someone like him end up in this prison? And why is he blocking my view?
Prisoner: If it's the first match of the day, it's often very crowded up here. And you'd quickly be afraid that you could fall down...

$
Prisoner: These "Knights of Night" are pretty smart, I tell you.
Prisoner: When most of the fighters figured out that they were very vulnerable to magic, they changed their tactics.
Prisoner: Now they cast "Reflect" on themselves! It's always a joy to see how stunned aspiring mages look when they get their spell thrown right back!

Announcer: Our next battle is just around the corner! The first combatant enters the arena!
Announcer: THE ZINKAR BUTCHERS!
Announcer: Oh! This group has set itself a goal! But this is still far away, a long way through the ranking is waiting for you!
Announcer: Let's hope that your name says it all!
Announcer: Slowly but surely they are getting closer to their goal! Will they hold out until the bitter end? And are they really up to their archenemy when the time comes?
Cibon: And whether we are!
Announcer: You want to see Zinkar blood! The brothers should be careful! Your archenemy is on the way to them and seems almost unstoppable!
Announcer: THE SUNBREAD SQUAD!
Announcer: This would be the first bakery company to enter this arena! Let's hope for them that they only fight for the bread and not LIKE the bread!
Announcer: You can fight better than you would expect from bread! But let's wait and see! Perhaps the opponent with the bread knife will find the end of their way!
Cibon: Urgs ... it was really bad.
Announcer: The bread that everyone fears! Her crust hard as steel and sharp as the finest blacksmithing. One enemy after the other they got stuck in their necks!
Cibon: Can anyone tell this guy he's not funny?
Announcer: THE BRIGANTINE PRIDE!
Announcer: ... brigands ... proud?
Announcer: Of course! The pride of our nation! Here in our prison! Our model prisoners! If only everyone in Brigantia behaved like our humble friends here!
Announcer: Oh yes ... WE WOULD COUNT THE ENTIRE BRIGAN ORDER TO OUR PARTICIPANTS! Wouldn't that be great?
Cibon: It was so clear that it went like this ... < I saw this coming miles away...
Soko: We'll see who ends up laughing here! < We'll see who gets the last laugh!
Announcer: Oh yes! Our role model prisoners again! We can certainly be proud of our traitors. If I think about it ... shouldn't it rather be KORZOJENOS PROUD ?!
Soko: ... Damn ...
Cibon: Really an excellent name choice.
Announcer: They may have sold us to Korzojeno and stayed with us prisoners, but they have shown us that their martial art is indeed something to be proud of!
Announcer: Yes, maybe all of Brigantia!
Soko: We didn't sell anything to Korzojeno, they just don't want to understand it ...
Kento: At least they're starting to take us seriously.
Announcer: THE TRAITORS!
Announcer: If not our colleagues from the brigand order who would rather work for our treacherous neighboring country!
Announcer: Now you are here in Brigantia, but you will no longer be able to help your client! The only thing left for them is to fight!
Announcer: And here they are again to fight! Obviously there is nothing interesting to tell Korzojeno here!
Soko: ... how often do you want to hack on it?
Announcer: They fight, oh yes and how they fight! We can be glad that they are doing it here and not in a battle with our neighboring country under the leadership of Farenia!
Cibon: The guy can also be very glad that he's not down here ... < should be very glad < better be glad he's up there and not down here
---
Announcer: And here comes their opponent!
Announcer: And here comes their next opponent!
Announcer: THE SLIMEALGAMATION!
Announcer: All beginners in this tournament have to fight their way through this association of Glibber first!
Announcer: Although they are rarely ranked higher than the last, there were already people who were founded under their magical flames and water fountains!
Cibon: Hey, what losers, aren't you mate?
Kento: Be quiet.
Soko: Huh?
Announcer: THE PACK!
Announcer: We found them in the darkest region of the Silvanwald and it wasn't easy to bring them here to the arena!
Announcer: But now they are here and they will show their opponents what the rules of the wild look like!
Cibon: Damn it just a few wolves.
Announcer: THE BEAR BROTHERS!
Announcer: They are big, furry and strong! Many weapons have failed because of their thick fur. And they know how to hit back!
Announcer: THE FEJAR SLITTERS!
Announcer: Too bad that the participants here don't have any Fejar to cut them off. Nevertheless, they are quick, agile and know how to restrict their opponents!
Announcer: THE TERROR FROM BELOW!
Announcer: Right, it is exactly the beasts that are feared by all mine workers here! Now they even go so far as to threaten the tournament fighters!
Announcer: THE SHADOW CRAWLERS!
Announcer: You know how to stab your opponent in the back. Your deadly technique kills the victim before they notice anything!
Announcer: But don't misjudge them! Your combat technique is as deadly in the open as it is in the dark night!
Announcer: THE EXOTICS!
Announcer: Nobody knows exactly where they come from, but their combat technology is second to none on the Toras continent! Your opponent will have to adjust to something completely new!
Announcer: THE KNIGHTS OF NIGHT!
Announcer: Your mighty appearance in dark armor has made many opponents tremble! But their appearance is not a spectacle!
Announcer: Many opponents have failed on their defensive!
Announcer: THE AVENGERS OF THE JUST!
Announcer: They steal from the rich and give it to the poor, or so they say. Too bad that there is no property for the prisoners here in prison!
Announcer: But their leader actually knows how to handle the bows! Your opponent should be careful!
Announcer: THE ZINKAR BROTHERS!
Announcer: This group really got up quickly! With their extraordinary teamwork they have made it far!
Announcer: With a dagger, claw and fighting stick they have already taught many opponents a lesson!
Announcer: THE PAUAMAINER VETERANS!
Announcer: Many opponents have perished from their deadly ore mining technique! And when someone was still standing, he had to swallow the fire of her dynamite arrows!
Announcer: THE BOSS HIMSELF!
Announcer: The leader of the Pauamainer, he has been in first place for ages and he does not intend to hand him over!
Announcer: And everyone who questions this place gets thunder slides and cyclones in response! Another epic battle is upon us!
Announcer: The leader of the Pauamain team and the longest leader in our tournament history. Now he was beaten and lost his first place.
Announcer: Will he be able to fight him back? Another big fight is ahead!
Announcer: GET READY TO RUMBLE!

<# And the crowd goes wild! (somewhere)
Announcer: The Zinkar butchers slaughter all opponents to reach their final victim! Another win for them!
Announcer: The Zinkar butchers have come a step closer to their goal! Another win. The Zinkar brothers should be ready!
Announcer: The Repsbrot troop turns out to be really tough! This opponent will have to chew their opponents for a long time!
Cibon: Oh GOD ...
Announcer: The Repsbrot troop wins! What a fight! Blood and sweat flowed and reps cores flew!
Cibon: What a pipe!
Announcer: The brigand pride has won, as expected from our role model prisoners!
Announcer: The brigand pride has won! Did her great! We are all very proud of you.
Cibon: Thank you very much.
Soko: ...
Announcer: The traitors are victorious! Korzojeno must really regret losing these capable people!
Announcer: The traitors have won! Korzojeno seems to have a good grasp when choosing her spies!
Announcer: Your current rank is \ v [1886]
Announcer: How's it going? Are you ready to take on another opponent?
Announcer: A note because you are new. You have no way to reassemble or top up your equipment and you will not be healed.
Announcer: You can only heal yourself with existing items and change your armor if you have something to change.
Announcer: So, do you want to fight again?
Fight Again?
Announcer: Our winner is ready to take on another opponent! Applause for this participant!
Announcer: The Zinkar butchers have enough for today. Tomorrow is a new day! The Zinkar brothers will not run away after all!
Announcer: The Repsbrot troop has enough for today. Come on! You can curl up now!
Cibon: ARGS!
Announcer: The brigante pride has shone enough for today. Hopefully tomorrow we will have the opportunity to marvel at our model prisoners again!
Announcer: The traitors have fought enough for today. Now they can go back to their cells where they belong.
Soko: KILL !!!! 1
Note: These were just Soko's thoughts.
Announcer: This was the last battle of the Zinkar butchers. Tomorrow is a new day! The Zinkar brothers will not run away after all!
Announcer: For today this was the last fight of the Repsbrot troop. Come on! You can curl up now!
Cibon: ARGS!
Announcer: This was the last fight of brigant pride, for today. Hopefully tomorrow we will have the opportunity to marvel at our model prisoners again!
Announcer: That was the last traitor fight for today! Now they can go back to their cells where they belong.
Soko: KILL !!!! 1
Note: These were just Soko's thoughts.
Announcer: The Zinkar butchers have lost. What a shame! Will they ever reach their archenemy like this?
Announcer: The Repsbrot troop was beaten. Well, people like you are eaten here for breakfast!
Cibon: ... Ouch! And I'm not saying that because of any wounds!
Announcer: Our model prisoners were beaten! So how does something go? How should we be proud of such a group, please?
Announcer: Unfortunately that was nothing! The traitors were beaten! Yes, we like to see something like that!

$
Felcis: Oh? You're up here too? It's nice that the guards give the prisoners here so much free rein.
Felcis: The tournament is also quite entertaining, albeit a little barbaric for my taste.

$
Prisoner: If you don't mine enough ore, you get less and less food here. They don't care what your physical condition is.
Prisoner: That means that those too old and weak get less to eat and become even weaker.

$
Prisoner: The food here is horrendous. But all that matters is that you get something in your stomach.

$
Prisoner: The glow of these walls irritates me... I thought I'd get used to it as time went on, but it's as irritating as always.
Prisoner: That's why I can hardly sleep in my cell at night... If only I had something to cover the walls with, but no, prisoners don't get anything.

$
Prisoner: Did any of you happen to run into this strapping blond general before? Sir Dolaros is his name. What a man! <# The original meaning is probably lost, but I'm going with the spin that this person is messed up in the head.
Prisoner: I heard he interrogates certain prisoners every now and then and gets really hard at it...
Prisoner: Oh yeah... I wish I were the prisoner he'd interrogate...
Kento: T... That... I have no words.
Cibon: I... I don't even know where to begin...
Soko: S... So wrong, that's so wrong!

$
Prisoner: Ah, the ex-soldiers of the Brigantine Order. Hardly surprised that there's also a woman with you.
Prisoner: That's what happens when you put genders into roles they don't belong! I'd also go crazy if I had to keep standing in front of the stove!
Soko: You've got some nerve saying stuff like that! Me being here in prison isn't even remotely related to...
Kento: It's okay, Soko. Just ignore him and let him be.
Prisoner: Leave me alone.

$
Prisoner: Did you notice that they're already letting even monsters take part in the tournament? These are the guards' psuedo teams they keep around.
Prisoner: Though I have to wonder... Where do they lock them up when they're not in the arena?

$
Prisoner: Today, I saw one of those nasty magic-using worms down there in the mine. Every time I see them, I always lose my appetite for the rest of the day.
Kento: You still have to have some appetite left, right?
Soko: Oh no you don't, Kento!

$
Prisoner: I was in a prison in Domarkor before. Those were tough times. There, you had absolutely no freedom to move and there was only food every 2 to 3 days.
Prisoner: This is less of a prison and more like a labor camp if you ask me. Brigantia really seems to be primarily concerned with iron rather than torture.

$
Prisoner: I really don't get all of these people who still play or watch the tournament after work. All I want to do is go back into my cell.

$
Prisoner: If you wonder what that platform up there is for. Guards sometimes stand there and announce things to all the prisoners in the cafe.
Prisoner: You'd do well to not put yourself up there and draw a bunch of attention. The guards really don't like seeing this.

$
Prisoner: I've been here for three weeks now... I hate it, how did I end up here? All I did was pickpocket...
Prisoner: And now I'm here to work until my dying breath. I miss my family...
Soko: Crimes have to be punished...
Cibon: Yeah, but all of this just because of a little pickpocketing? Don't you think this went a little too far?
Kento: I think the problem is that all prisoners face the same fate here, regardless of why.
Prisoner: There has to be a way out of here... I can't live the rest of my life like this... <# Error?

$
Prisoner: Damn, I'm still hungry, but there aren't any second helpings! I'll have to work harder to make my portion bigger...
Soko: The idea of motivating prisoners by controlling how much food they get seems to work rather well...
Soko: Disgusting.
Cibon: We're gonna do our best tomorrow, aren't we, Kento?
Kento: You said it! We have to make our portions bigger.
Soko: Absolutely reprehensible...

...

Kento: It occurs to me that today you are likely to question another one of us again. < I remembered that < It came to my mind that < I just realized something. ...
Soko: You're right...
Kento: I told them some stories recently ...
Kento: You should make sure that you base your statements on this. Otherwise our lies will be exposed.
Cibon: And then what?
Kento: Then there's a beating. Even during mine work, they threatened me.
Cibon: So what did you tell them?
Soko: Kento, if you see through our lies, you will think that we want to know and keep things secret, right?
Kento: ... you could be right ...
Soko: Lying is always only a temporary way out. And they can interrogate us here for months if they feel like it.
Soko: Telling you the truth may be harder at first, but it's the only way to end the interviews in the long run.
Cibon: Great, now I honestly don't know what to do.
Kento: Maybe Soko is right, it could make more sense to simply say permanently that you don't know anything.
Cibon: I think I'll decide when the time comes. Just tell me what you said to them.
---
Soko: I wonder what's going on outside. Did Brigantia find this group in the meantime?
Kento: Such news should spread quickly, even here in prison ...
Soko: If they discover the troop, it will probably be clear that we are not spies! Maybe we'll get out of here ...
Kento: Well, we heard yesterday that prisoners are usually not released here.
Kento: A big animal has to pull us out of here.
Soko: ...
Cibon: You could really be a little more optimistic, buddy. Our situation is desperate enough.
Cibon: They'll probably be questioning you today, Soko.
Soko: Yes ...
Kento: How are you going to behave now?
Soko: I don't know ... does it really make sense to tell them lies all the time?
Soko: We won't keep this up, so at least I won't ...
Soko: And it looks like we won't get out of here as soon ...
Kento: So you want to call innocence? You know that all our lies will be exposed.
Kento: Cibon and I will have to face the consequences ...
Soko: I ... I forgot ...
Cibon: Don't be considerate of me, Soko. They can't beat me up much more than last time.
Kento: Well, just do what you think is right. We'll get through this.
---
Kento: Oh, Felcis, I haven't quite understood one thing yet.
Kento: What does someone like you in this country have to do beyond the border? You said you were an envoy from the aristocracy ...
Felcis: Oh, well, I had an inspection job at the border.
Felcis: There have been a lot of rumors lately about an underground passage leading under the border.
Felcis: According to these rumors, this passage is due to the gangs of robbers roaming around here.
Felcis: I think it goes without saying that this is neither in the interests of Korzojeno nor Brigantia.
Felcis: After all, borders are not built so that you can walk freely underneath.
Felcis: So I was assigned a small group of soldiers to get to the bottom of it.
Felcis: And indeed. There was a passage. And their dimensions far exceeded my expectations.
Felcis: It's more than just a small tunnel. Rather, it is a large cave system that runs through the border.
Felcis: Big enough to lose his people there. This is exactly what happened to me when we were chased by a gang of robbers.
Felcis: I was lucky enough to find my way back in the end, but ended up in Brigantia.
Felcis: My people were still missing and since I'm not the type to let their people down, I wanted to ask for help here.
Felcis: And now I'm sitting here. And all I can do is hope that my people got away on their own.
Cibon: Okay ... that's pretty bad ...
Soko: What are they actually thinking here? They can't just lock someone up here!
Soko: You have to get confirmation from the council, or from a higher general in the west, at least!
Soko: This is insane!
Felcis: Well, yes < pseudo-scrolling
Felcis: Well, THAT'S HELNOVIA !!! < THIS IS HELNOVIEN <! \\. like "this is Sparta"
Felcis: Well, THAT'S HELNOVIA, as I've been told about it.
Felcis: Brigantia's land on your own initiative! Here people are still full of fresh ideas!
Felcis: Here, where this spoil of advice can't complain permanently thanks to the blockade of the Toras Mountains.
Felcis: If I had known that Korzojeno was currently under suspicion, I would not have dared to go here.
Felcis: Well, that's life. If you excuse me, I'll take a look around here ...
Soko: It's a strange coincidence that we suddenly meet such a person ...
Cibon: What do you think? Do you believe him that Korzojeno has nothing to do with this group, but Brigantia is behind it?
Soko: I can't imagine someone in the Council planning something like this ...
Kento: It is, of course, in the spirit of this Felcis to free the aristocracy from suspicion ...
Kento: From this point of view, it is quite possible that he will give us wrong facts ...
Cibon: Well, even if - does it make a difference for us? We're not in the Council here, we're in a prison.
Soko: Where you're right ...
---
Cibon: I can't believe it! How did you get such a portion together without really mining ore?
Felcis: Oh well. I played some ore carrier.
Felcis: Since I was mainly talking to people anyway, I offered to take the ore to the collection point for them.
Felcis: For just 10% deduction that went to me, people didn't have to drag the ore themselves.
Felcis: A surprising number of them have already responded to this. Above all these Pauamainer colleagues, for ore chopping is the meaning of life.
Kento: Not bad.
Cibon: Pah! Something like that is called scrounging! < scavenging
Felcis: But to something else. I need your help right away if possible.
Kento: what is it about?
Felcis: For our "plan" we need another item.
Felcis: I still had this item with me, fortunately the guards hadn't spotted it.
Felcis: I just had to spoil my luck with stupid clumsiness. I lost the thing.
Cibon: fool.
Felcis: Now this item is in the hands of a prisoner who is unwilling to give it back to me ...
Cibon: Oh, didn't you ask kindly enough?
Felcis: I could have asked as nicely as I wanted, the guy just has something against me or more about my background.
Soko: Please?
Felcis: We should just pay the guys a visit after dinner. Maybe we can do something more.
---
Felcis: Okay, it'll probably be a while before we get the stuff out of the mine.
Felcis: Well, the blasting was probably nothing today, but tomorrow is still a working day.
Felcis: In the meantime we can try to take our beautiful stone off this Robin ...
---
Felcis: Well, now that we have our powder, all we need is the stone.
Felcis: Our proletariat-protecting Grünhut is still watching over this at the moment. Time to free him of this burden.
Cibon: As soon as possible! I'm looking forward to it.
Soko: We mustn't take this fight carelessly, understand?
Kento: Yes, we should spare the Robin this extra pain.
Soko: Him - and you too.
---
Cibon: Right. I can well imagine how the guy interprets our hesitation ...
Kento: Well, if he underestimates us, that can only be an advantage.
Cibon: Our team name is Repsbrot troop. We are underestimated either way.
Soko: Good bread takes time to rise properly. Robin should be able to imagine that.
Felcis: You called yourself a Repsbrot troop? A truly delicious choice of names.
Cibon: Stop that!
Kento: Yes, as long as the stone is with Robin, anything can happen to it ...
Kento: What if he lost it, someone stole it, or the guards discovered it?
Felcis: I think this Robin knows how to protect his treasures. He has experience with it ...
Felcis: It looks like we have everything together. That means we can get started as soon as you are ready.
Felcis: We don't have to do it today, but we shouldn't wait too long either.
Felcis: As of today, I'll hang out here in the canteen every evening. Let me know when you're ready.
Kento: One more question, Felcis. We are now able to break the barrier, but what about the rest?
Kento: Just because the barrier is broken does not mean that we can walk out comfortably.
Felcis: You are absolutely right. However, I already have a plan for how to distract the guards.
Felcis: I'll tell you when we start the operation.
Felcis: Talk to me in the canteen when you're ready.
Kento: This Felcis really has its way of enlightening us at the last possible moment ...
Felcis: Well, we have everything together. Let me know when you're ready, I'm still waiting up here in the canteen.
Felcis: Don't take too much time.

...

Saion: Hmpf! We'll win our tournament place back, just you wait!
Jorn: I see many months of cruel battles coming on me. Someone get me out of here, please!
Saion: Jorn, will you please stop complaining all the time?
Saion: Gurim and I survive the whole thing without complaining! So get yourself together!
Jorn: We all know by now that you like to be beaten up, and that Gurim never complains as well!
Jorn: Nobody is forcing us to do all these fights, have you ever thought of it?
Jorn: Damn, by now I would even prefer to work regularly in the mine instead of performing in the tournament again!
Saion: I am doing my best here to create a good reputation for us here and to move us forward!
Saion: And everything you do is gripe, gripe, gripe! You should be grateful to me for pulling you along at all!
Jorn: GRATEFUL ?! It is YOUR fault that we ended up here in the first place! Just because you absolutely wanted your fight back then!
Jorn: And even here fighting is the only thing you can think of!
Saion: I've told you several times! This life is in our blood! We, with the last name Zinkar, never lose out!
Saion: But what am I wondering at all. Of course you don't understand that! You are the BLACK SHEEP of the three of us!
Jorn: Right! I am the black sheep!
Jorn: Right! I am the black sheep! LUCKILY!
Jorn: Otherwise I would have this
Jorn: Otherwise I would have this IDIOT BLOOD in me that everyone
Jorn: Otherwise I would have this IDIOT BLOOD in me, which TAKES ALL MIND and one for me
Jorn: Otherwise I would have this IDIOT BLOOD in me that TAKES ALL MIND and gives me a THICK SKULL!
Saion: WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ?! COME BACK IMMEDIATELY!
Cibon: W ... what was that now ...
Soko: Gurim ... What was Jorn talking about?
Gurim: ... It's been a little while since they had an argument ...
Gurim: Jorn ... is really just a half brother of us ... Is a complicated subject ...
Gurim: In any case, Saion doesn't manage to overlook this thing ...
Gurim: Excuse me, but I should make sure the two are right ...
Soko: ... It seems there is something more behind all the arguments ...
Kento: It's not that we have to play psychiatrists here. It is their business and we should not interfere.
---
Felcis: So my friend, we won, you know what that means? Bring the clunker. < Hand it over.
Robin: Yes, yes. Alright. You were lucky this time. You can have your stone.
Robin: The next time we meet in the tournament, it won't be that easy for you!
---
Pauamainer Member: That was a top performance from you today! We haven't had such good opponents in a long time!
Pauamainer Member: Have a look at our base if you already belong to the Pauamainer underground brotherhood! We might have something for you.

...

Kento: That ... was clever.
Felcis: With the other sack we repeat the game to complete the trail to the cell.
Felcis: Tonight we're going to trigger the effect and break the barrier. Then the escape starts!
Kento: Okay ... and then what do we do? Just because the barrier is gone, we can't just walk out!
Felcis: We won't either. At least not alone. We'll all walk out there together.
Soko: How, together? Do you mean ... the other prisoners?
Felcis: Exactly. Once the barrier is gone, we can easily break the cells. If we run away in masses, the guards are overwhelmed.
Felcis: This is the only way we can escape.
Soko: But ... we can't just release all the prisoners!
Felcis: I knew it was going to be complicated ... Look, Soko, there are times like this when you have to give your code of honor a vacation.
Felcis: We were illegally locked up here, we will only get out illegally.
Soko: You say that so nicely! We don't have the right to decide on something like that! Prisoners are prisoners!
Felcis: If so, why did you agree to the escape plan in the first place? We are prisoners too, forget?
Felcis: Anyway. There is no way back. We're escaping tonight. Until then, you should rest and prepare yourself internally.
Felcis: I hope I can count on your support ...
Kento: Wait! Is that really all? Do you think that's enough to get past the guards? I hope you are not serious!
Felcis: There's more to come. Let yourself be surprised.
Cibon: The guy really gets on my nerves! What is so difficult about speaking plain text ?!
Kento: I can understand that he wanted to hide this one detail ...
Soko: I knew something like this was coming.
Kento: He's right ... Without the turmoil, it will be much harder to get out of here.
Soko: I know ... But do we really have to go that far? How low do we want to sink?
Cibon: Soko please, let's not drop at the last moment!
Soko: Alright ... let's just get out of here ...

<# ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!
Insane Girl: Ah! There you are again! What was going on?
Insane Girl: Well, where did I stop ... Hmm ... Oh yeah!
Insane Girl: I feel like accompanying you in the future. It's okay, isn't it?
Kento: Uhhhm ... well ...
Cibon: buddy, RACE!
Cibon: ARE YOU MADNESS ?! Do you want us all to get on our nerves?
Kento: The ... The question came so suddenly and unexpectedly! I wasn't prepared for it ...
Blond girl: Oh, hello! What are you doing here Somehow everything is so dark and dark here, isn't it?
Cibon: No matter how gloomy and dark it may be here, the presence of your beauty alone makes any desolation go away!
Blond girl: wow! How long has it been since I got such a great compliment!
Blond girl: the people here are all so grumpy and in a bad mood, but you're totally different! Great!
Blond girl: I thought my life had only been going downhill since I landed here.
Blond girl: And only because of a little theft! < And all because
Insane Girl: I just wanted to help two other people who were totally desperate.
Insane Girl: completely stupid! And now I have to work here in this terrible mine! It is exhausting!
Cibon: J ... Yes ... Really hard times here ...
Insane Girl: Yes! Exactly! It's great to have someone you can tell everything about, really! Knew what's going on here
It's great to have someone you can tell everything about, really! Did you know what happened to me here yesterday? I sat on
that you can tell everything, really! Did you know what happened to me here yesterday? I was sitting at a table and suddenly came
really! Did you know what happened to me here yesterday? I was sitting at a table and suddenly these prisoners came and went
happened yesterday? I was sitting at a table and suddenly these prisoners came and make fun of my ears! Full
a table and suddenly these prisoners came and make fun of my ears! Totally mean, isn't it? I was the one
these prisoners and make fun of my ears! Totally mean, isn't it? I was depressed all evening, whole
funny about my ears! Totally mean, isn't it? I was depressed all evening, all alone in my cell ...
mean, isn't it? I was depressed all evening, all alone in my cell ... My past was already
Depressed all evening, all alone in my cell ... My past was bad enough. I know my parents
alone in my cell ... My past was bad enough. I actually know my parents ...
Cibon: buddy! Let's get out of here!
Kento: ... insane. That you literally run away from a woman. What else I can experience.
Cibon: THERE ARE YOU WONDERFUL !? This brat would have cut my last nerves within the next 4 minutes!
Kento: Well, you have to admit. It was quite "entertaining".
Cibon: ... I want to have missed that ...

Man at the Counter: You've eaten enough for today. So don't stand around here!

Woman at the Counter: I'm sorry, there aren't any second servings.

Woman at the Counter: No prisoners are allowed through here! Don't go any further or we'll call the guards!

Man at the Counter: No prisoners are allowed through here! Don't go any further or we'll call the guards!

Felcis: Well? Are you ready?
Kento: Now we have your stone and the greyhound powder ... and still have no idea what your plan looks like. It's time for you to educate us.
Felcis: Well ... As I said before, I have to break the magic barrier - and this is possible with this stone and the gray-powdered powder.
Felcis: This protective barrier is maintained with a machine. It is near here, on the 1st floor of this building.
Felcis: All we have to do is bring this stone close to the machine to trigger its effect.
Soko: How do you trigger the effect? Through Signum?
Felcis: Exactly. The right spell and the bomb detonates.
Soko: But don't you have to be right next to the stone? How are we supposed to get so close to the machine with the stone?
Felcis: Well, that's where the greyhawk powder comes in!
Felcis: Greyhound powder enhances the effect of Signum sayings, but can also be used to extend the area of effect.
Felcis: And we do exactly that. With the help of the gray-sparkling powder we make a fuse from our cell to the stone at the machine.
Cibon: So so. Then how do you want to get the stone to the machine? Or pull the fuse? Really a great plan.
Felcis: So, well! Don't doubt here!
Felcis: In such situations, we at the nobility alliance always know how to help ourselves with the right trick!
Felcis: Ladies and gentlemen, two bags! Both full of sparkling dust, but only one with a magical stone.
Felcis: Dear lady, please hold this for a moment.
Soko: Um ... okay?
Felcis: We now provide the other sack, the one with the pebble inside, with a mystical aura ....
Felcis: And now the grand finale! See and be amazed!
Kento: Um ... Felcis? Where are you going?
Guard: So ... what kind of rubbish is that? A sack ... full of powder? Whatever it is, it no longer belongs to you!
Guard: Stop here, I'll just take it away.
Cibon: What the hell was that. Did you just have this one sack ... all our hope ...
Cibon: LOST TO THE GUARDIANS ?!
Cibon: It looks like this. What a pitty.
Cibon: Listen! You can not be serious?!
Felcis: Calm down, calm down, Cibon! Everything is going according to plan. What do you think where this bag is going now?
Soko: Probably in a camp ...
Felcis: Exactly! Now I know from a reliable source where exactly this camp is and now guess what is directly below it?
Cibon: ... The ... machine?
Felcis: Bingo!
Kento: And what about the fuse to the stone?
Felcis: Well, it's being laid right now.
Felcis: Alright, but don't take too much time.

Pauamainer Member: This is the base of the underground Pauamainer Brotherhood!
Pauamainer Member: ONLY MEMBERS HAVE ACCESS!!
Kento: Okay okay, I understand. We have all miner medallions here. Can we pass now?
Pauamainer Member: YOU HAVE COLLECTED ALL EIGHT MINER MEDALLIONS! SO NOW YOU THREE ARE OFFICIALLY MEMBERS OF THE UNDERGROUND PAUAMAINER BROTHERHOOD! WELCOME! <# pseudo scroller
Cibon: Yay, we're in the brotherhood! Even Soko!
Soko: ...
Pauamainer Member: YOU MAY PASS!
Pauamainer Member: If you want to become a member, BRING ME EIGHT MINER MEDALLIONS!!
Kento: Miner medallions? Um... Where do we find these?
Pauamainer Member: EIGHT PAUAMAINER MEMBERS who work in the far corners of the mine will award you the medallions WHEN YOU REACH THEM!!!
Soko: Does this guy always have to scream so loud?
Cibon: Do you really think the guy can speak normally?

Pauamainer Member: VISIT US SOON!
Pauamainer Member: HELLO BROTHERS! YOU MAY PASS!

Prisoner: We are staring with particular interest at the wall that you are currently able to cover. Get out of here.

Felcis: Hello you, I'm back because of the pebble ...
Prisoner: I already told you that you won't get it again. We will definitely not give anything to a blue-blooded pack like you! You know our motto! < robber barons / smells of nobility / silver platter
Felcis: Yes, we all know it. We all don't want to hear it again ...
Prisoner: WE STEAL FROM THE RICH AND GIVE IT TO THE POOR! We bring justice to this corrupt world, oh yes we do!
Cibon: What the hell?
Felcis: I would like to remind you that you are in a prison here and you can hardly do anything with this motto.
Prisoner: Why? I see a wonderful start for this right now! YOU are nobility, you are rich. WE are poor! So we keep your clunker, it's that simple!
Soko: You're not quite right on the head? You think your theft is fair because of such a status question? I'm not laughing!
Prisoner: But hello! We have a pretty lady here. May I introduce myself? Robin Llewlynus my name.
Soko: Soko Filaja. What ever. Now what about this stone?
Robin: I would love to give it to you if I didn't know you were hanging out with this screwed up bigwig!
Felcis: The colored peacock from Farenia - there is no property here in prison!
Felcis: Apart from that, your motto is just a farce anyway, so that you don't bear the anger of the small population on you.
Felcis: Don't think I haven't heard from you before. You divide the property? Certainly.
Felcis: That explains, above all, all the riches that were found in your base when you were caught.
Felcis: You may give a coin from the treasure chest to the local farmers, they don't have to know what you have.
Robin: You can tell your stories!
Kento: But not a bad idea in itself. So you get support from the people there when you need it.
Cibon: Haha, what weaklings! They probably used the peasants to hide from the soldiers.
Robin: Now don't get wrong thoughts! If you only knew which aristocratic troops we all attacked and robbed! They all had their escorts.
Cibon: Yes, yes, there is a lot to tell. I bet even we three new additions to the Brigant Order could easily sweep you away!
Cibon: In a tournament fight, for example.
Cibon: Yes, yes, there is a lot to tell. You can't even take on three new members of the Brigade Order with us!
Cibon: You remember the tournament fight, don't you?
Robin: Oh yes? Try it! You can see where we are in the tournament, the "Avengers of the Just"! I bet you won't be able to defeat any of the three of us!
Robin: Oh yes? Don't imagine anything just because you were last successful! We just held back! We can finish you anytime, we bet?
Felcis: With the stone, I assume? You don't have much else.
Robin: How? Stone? Moment!
Felcis: Your commitment. We bet on the stone. If our 3 ex-soldiers win here, we'll get him, otherwise you'll keep him.
Robin: Ha! You dream of that! We don't get involved in something like that.
Cibon: How? Are you suddenly afraid that you could lose against us?
Robin: Ha ... Ha! You would like that! Okay, we'll go over the bet. Under one condition!
Robin: Should WE - as is to be expected - win, we will keep the stone AND your pretty friend here will "come and visit" us in the evening after work.
Soko: W..W..W..W ..
Soko: W..W..W..W..HOW PLEASE ?!
Cibon: Ah ... Ahahahahahahahahahahah! Are you sure about that?
Felcis: Alright! The bet counts!
Soko: W ... WHAT?!?! Are you still whole ...
Kento: Please, Soko ... just hold back a little ...
Felcis: That would probably settle everything. See you in the arena!
Robin: Haha, with joy!
Soko: SAY, ARE YOU STILL TIGHT?!?!
Felcis: Woha! What a temper, weird!
Soko: You also have every reason to be afraid.
Felcis: Calm down, Soko, calm down! Everything will be fine! Trust me...
Soko: How should everything go well here? What happens if we lose ?!
Cibon: Come on Soko, we won't lose against them! You'll probably take care of that yourself ...
Felcis: I'm sorry, but I saw in this bet the only way to get this stone back ...
Felcis: Who knows if we would have gotten this far again if we had refused because of you ...
Kento: G ... Exactly ... Besides ... even if we lose, all they're going to get is a lot of ... pain ...
Cibon: You say it, buddy!
Soko: How? Ah...
Soko: Sorry Kento, but I just couldn't hold it back ...
Soko: Alright. We just won't lose. Everything will be fine...
Kento: By the way, Felcis, what kind of stone is that anyway?
Felcis: This stone contains special Signum powers. No powers with which they would know what to do ...
Felcis: But for us this stone is absolutely necessary. Without this, we will not be able to break the barrier.
Felcis: But please don't tell anyone about it. The thing should remain nothing more than a beautiful sparkling stone.
Cibon: Banged! Then we should watch that we turn this Eumel into a snail in the tournament!
Soko: Yes and woe if not! I hope you remember who you share your cell with, Felcis!

Robin: We'll see you in the tournament then, haha!

Robin: Now you have your clunker again, I hope you are satisfied! But just wait! You rich bags will experience your downfall sooner or later!
Felcis: Ignore it. Simply ignore...

Prisoner: We give it to the poor because they really need it, oh yes we do!

Prisoner: We steal from the rich to make them less rich, oh yes we do!

Saion: You again. We'll see each other again in the tournament, just wait!
Soko: What's going on between you? You should talk about your problems instead of ...
Saion: Our problems? What is it that interests you? Take care of your own stuff!
Kento: Come on Soko, better leave it ...
Saion: Pah! The fact that you hit again means nothing! I demand revenge!
Jorn: Rule number one of the Zinkar brothers: We never learn our lesson!
Saion: Jorn, you kindly keep your cheeky mouth!
Saion: Ha! The Zinkar butchers are progressing, it seems. You will be surprised who slaughters whom!
Jorn: Your name is on the agenda!
Saion: Shut up, Jorn!
Saion: Place \ v [1886] are you already now? Not long now and our fight is imminent! Oh yeah!
Jorn: Oh joy.
Saion: Do you see? Even this stubborn redhead from brother is looking forward to this fight!
Jorn: Stubborn brother? Someone must have stuck a mirror to me somewhere.
Saion: What does that mean again ?!
Saion: Oh hello! There are the "Zinkar butchers"! Pretty self-confident when choosing a name, I just say!
Jorn: I already feel like fresh meat. < to be sliced
Saion: Quiet, Jorn! You always with your pessimistic manner.
Saion: Ha! And? What rank do you have now? We are all waiting impatiently for your challenge!
Jorn: Are we doing this?
Saion: We'll prove we can take on brigand order soldiers!
Jorn: You can just attack a couple of guards if you want to prove it.
Saion: Be quiet, Jorn!

Jorn: ... please leave me in peace, yes?
Jorn: I hope you had fun. You can try to fight these Pauamainers. They are really violent.
Jorn: I have to know, as often as Saion has taken on us ... And her boss is beyond our borders anyway ...
Saion: This is so typical of you again! Just howling and whining!
Jorn: After half a dozen defeats against this guy, I have every reason to do so!
Jorn: It looks like it will soon be a "slaughter festival". And I thought that ambition would only have this blue-haired mischief from brother.
Jorn: Well, wonderful, you are getting closer and closer to our place. You really mean it, don't you?
Cibon: Come on, it's just a tournament fight. And your brother didn't want it any other way.
Jorn: Yes, but I'm being dragged into this mess. Nobody asks me!
Soko: Believe me, on our side it's not necessarily that different.
Cibon: How, where, what? You never really complained, Soko!
Soko: So what? That doesn't mean that I like the stuff.
Jorn: Hey, I think we understand each other then.
Jorn: Come on, Soko, we're making a pact! We both will just go on strike and do nothing during the fight!
Soko: Sounds interesting.
Cibon: Now don't get stupid thoughts!
Jorn: Zinkar Butcher ... Very great name choice. Now I can't sleep peacefully during the night.
Saion: You're such a scaredy bunny! What does a name mean? You can see how far we've come!
Jorn: What? Fear is such a wonderful thing. It keeps you from doing stupid things.
Jorn: And some people here could really use a little more fear ...
Jorn: You really don't have to hurry with this tournament story.
Jorn: I'm really happy if my brother can't find an opponent to fight for a day ...
Soko: May I ask why you are doing everything your brother imposes on you?
Soko: You don't seem to agree very often ...
Jorn: Well ... um ... we're brothers?
Jorn: It's not that I know people I could go to when I leave my brothers.
Jorn: Besides, you can't imagine what kind of theater Saion would do in this case ...
Saion: What are you talking about over there?
Jorn: We are currently discussing whether your actions are due to a lack of intelligence or a mental disorder.
Saion: What the ... I act exactly as we have to act as a gang of thieves!
Jorn: Yes, you could really discuss the topic for a long time.

Gurim: ...
Gurim: Congratulations on your victory.
Cibon: Thank you, you fought well too.
Gurim: We'll see you in the tournament ...
Cibon: I'm curious to see if your fighting style has improved with this strange weapon.
Kento: Speaking of weird weapons. Are you still struggling with this filled pouch, Jorn?
Jorn: The one? No way! We wouldn't have enough items to fill it with a solid weight.
Kento: What are you fighting with?
Jorn: Well ... you'll see ...
Gurim: Hello ...
Soko: You are really a welcome change compared to your talkative brothers.
Gurim: D ... thank you ...

Pauamainer Member: Ah, some new members I see! Great! We're happy for every enthusiastic miner! Good luck!
Pauamainer Member: Have you been to my colleague over there? If you're new here, you'll receive a small gift from us.
Pauamainer Member: Have you ever noticed that the railways near the cliffs actually goes on?
Pauamainer Member: There used to be a large area to mine in which got separated due to the earthquake!
Pauamainer Member: What do you think, how much ore might've been there?! It's a shame, isn't it...

Kento: Hmph... It won't budge.

Pauamainer Member: Ah, I see! So you've collected all the medallions and were able to get in here? Congratulations! You're now officially a member of the underground Pauamainer Brotherhood.
Pauamainer Member: We have a gift for newcomers like you. Come, go through and get it.
Pauamainer Member: I hope you've done enough good work so that the guards look the other way when you leave with this item!
Pauamainer Member: Since we're keeping watch here, we stay in the mine a little longer until all the people are really gone. Yep, we're allowed to do so. You should go back now.

Kento: Hmph... It won't budge.

Pauamainer Member: This is the area of the Pauamainer Veterans! For years, we've been at the top of the tournament! Only our boss can outdo us.
Pauamainer Member: And you can see it again. Only those who work hard in the mine can get far in the tournament!
Pauamainer Member: Those who work hard in the mine train their body and mind! This is better than any typical combat training!!
Kento: Um... Yeah... Suuure...
Pauamainer Member: Hey, it's closing time. Don't think we're getting out of here because of stuff like that. We don't leave before you do, don't forget that. So go ahead, go back.
Pauamainer Member: Oh! So you're the ones who beat us in the tournament! That was a great fight.
Pauamainer Member: In this way, we were able to recognize our weaknesses and can now improve further!
Pauamainer Member: Here, take the item out of the chest as a token of our gratitude.
Pauamainer Member: At some point, we'll see each other again in the tournament!

Pauamainer Member: That was a really good fight! It was almost better than finding even a new and untouched vein of ore!

Pauamainer Member: Great work in the tournament.

Kento: Hmph... It won't budge.
