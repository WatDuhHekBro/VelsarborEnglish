Announcer: Our next battle is just around the corner! The first combatant enters the arena!
Announcer: THE ZINKAR BUTCHERS!
Announcer: Oh! This group has set itself a goal! But this is still far away, a long way through the ranking is waiting for you!
Announcer: Let's hope that your name says it all!
Announcer: Slowly but surely they are getting closer to their goal! Will they hold out until the bitter end? And are they really up to their archenemy when the time comes?
Cibon: And whether we are!
Announcer: You want to see Zinkar blood! The brothers should be careful! Your archenemy is on the way to them and seems almost unstoppable!
Announcer: THE SUNBREAD SQUAD!
Announcer: This would be the first bakery company to enter this arena! Let's hope for them that they only fight for the bread and not LIKE the bread!
Announcer: You can fight better than you would expect from bread! But let's wait and see! Perhaps the opponent with the bread knife will find the end of their way!
Cibon: Urgs ... it was really bad.
Announcer: The bread that everyone fears! Her crust hard as steel and sharp as the finest blacksmithing. One enemy after the other they got stuck in their necks!
Cibon: Can anyone tell this guy he's not funny?
Announcer: THE BRIGANTINE PRIDE!
Announcer: ... brigands ... proud?
Announcer: Of course! The pride of our nation! Here in our prison! Our model prisoners! If only everyone in Brigantia behaved like our humble friends here!
Announcer: Oh yes ... WE WOULD COUNT THE ENTIRE BRIGAN ORDER TO OUR PARTICIPANTS! Wouldn't that be great?
Cibon: It was so clear that it went like this ... < I saw this coming miles away...
Soko: We'll see who ends up laughing here! < We'll see who gets the last laugh!
Announcer: Oh yes! Our role model prisoners again! We can certainly be proud of our traitors. If I think about it ... shouldn't it rather be KORZOJENOS PROUD ?!
Soko: ... Damn ...
Cibon: Really an excellent name choice.
Announcer: They may have sold us to Korzojeno and stayed with us prisoners, but they have shown us that their martial art is indeed something to be proud of!
Announcer: Yes, maybe all of Brigantia!
Soko: We didn't sell anything to Korzojeno, they just don't want to understand it ...
Kento: At least they're starting to take us seriously.
Announcer: THE TRAITORS!
Announcer: If not our colleagues from the brigand order who would rather work for our treacherous neighboring country!
Announcer: Now you are here in Brigantia, but you will no longer be able to help your client! The only thing left for them is to fight!
Announcer: And here they are again to fight! Obviously there is nothing interesting to tell Korzojeno here!
Soko: ... how often do you want to hack on it?
Announcer: They fight, oh yes and how they fight! We can be glad that they are doing it here and not in a battle with our neighboring country under the leadership of Farenia!
Cibon: The guy can also be very glad that he's not down here ... < should be very glad < better be glad he's up there and not down here
---
Announcer: And here comes their opponent!
Announcer: And here comes their next opponent!
Announcer: THE SLIMEALGAMATION!
Announcer: All beginners in this tournament have to fight their way through this association of Glibber first!
Announcer: Although they are rarely ranked higher than the last, there were already people who were founded under their magical flames and water fountains!
Cibon: Hey, what losers, aren't you mate?
Kento: Be quiet.
Soko: Huh?
Announcer: THE PACK!
Announcer: We found them in the darkest region of the Silvanwald and it wasn't easy to bring them here to the arena!
Announcer: But now they are here and they will show their opponents what the rules of the wild look like!
Cibon: Damn it just a few wolves.
Announcer: THE BEAR BROTHERS!
Announcer: They are big, furry and strong! Many weapons have failed because of their thick fur. And they know how to hit back!
Announcer: THE FEJAR SLITTERS!
Announcer: Too bad that the participants here don't have any Fejar to cut them off. Nevertheless, they are quick, agile and know how to restrict their opponents!
Announcer: THE TERROR FROM BELOW!
Announcer: Right, it is exactly the beasts that are feared by all mine workers here! Now they even go so far as to threaten the tournament fighters!
Announcer: THE SHADOW CRAWLERS!
Announcer: You know how to stab your opponent in the back. Your deadly technique kills the victim before they notice anything!
Announcer: But don't misjudge them! Your combat technique is as deadly in the open as it is in the dark night!
Announcer: THE EXOTICS!
Announcer: Nobody knows exactly where they come from, but their combat technology is second to none on the Toras continent! Your opponent will have to adjust to something completely new!
Announcer: THE KNIGHTS OF NIGHT!
Announcer: Your mighty appearance in dark armor has made many opponents tremble! But their appearance is not a spectacle!
Announcer: Many opponents have failed on their defensive!
Announcer: THE AVENGERS OF THE JUST!
Announcer: They steal from the rich and give it to the poor, or so they say. Too bad that there is no property for the prisoners here in prison!
Announcer: But their leader actually knows how to handle the bows! Your opponent should be careful!
Announcer: THE ZINKAR BROTHERS!
Announcer: This group really got up quickly! With their extraordinary teamwork they have made it far!
Announcer: With a dagger, claw and fighting stick they have already taught many opponents a lesson!
Announcer: THE PAUAMAINER VETERANS!
Announcer: Many opponents have perished from their deadly ore mining technique! And when someone was still standing, he had to swallow the fire of her dynamite arrows!
Announcer: THE BOSS HIMSELF!
Announcer: The leader of the Pauamainer, he has been in first place for ages and he does not intend to hand him over!
Announcer: And everyone who questions this place gets thunder slides and cyclones in response! Another epic battle is upon us!
Announcer: The leader of the Pauamain team and the longest leader in our tournament history. Now he was beaten and lost his first place.
Announcer: Will he be able to fight him back? Another big fight is ahead!
Announcer: GET READY TO RUMBLE!

<# And the crowd goes wild! (somewhere)
Announcer: The Zinkar butchers slaughter all opponents to reach their final victim! Another win for them!
Announcer: The Zinkar butchers have come a step closer to their goal! Another win. The Zinkar brothers should be ready!
Announcer: The Repsbrot troop turns out to be really tough! This opponent will have to chew their opponents for a long time!
Cibon: Oh GOD ...
Announcer: The Repsbrot troop wins! What a fight! Blood and sweat flowed and reps cores flew!
Cibon: What a pipe!
Announcer: The brigand pride has won, as expected from our role model prisoners!
Announcer: The brigand pride has won! Did her great! We are all very proud of you.
Cibon: Thank you very much.
Soko: ...
Announcer: The traitors are victorious! Korzojeno must really regret losing these capable people!
Announcer: The traitors have won! Korzojeno seems to have a good grasp when choosing her spies!
Announcer: Your current rank is \ v [1886]
Announcer: How's it going? Are you ready to take on another opponent?
Announcer: A note because you are new. You have no way to reassemble or top up your equipment and you will not be healed.
Announcer: You can only heal yourself with existing items and change your armor if you have something to change.
Announcer: So, do you want to fight again?
Fight Again?
Announcer: Our winner is ready to take on another opponent! Applause for this participant!
Announcer: The Zinkar butchers have enough for today. Tomorrow is a new day! The Zinkar brothers will not run away after all!
Announcer: The Repsbrot troop has enough for today. Come on! You can curl up now!
Cibon: ARGS!
Announcer: The brigante pride has shone enough for today. Hopefully tomorrow we will have the opportunity to marvel at our model prisoners again!
Announcer: The traitors have fought enough for today. Now they can go back to their cells where they belong.
Soko: KILL !!!! 1
Note: These were just Soko's thoughts.
Announcer: This was the last battle of the Zinkar butchers. Tomorrow is a new day! The Zinkar brothers will not run away after all!
Announcer: For today this was the last fight of the Repsbrot troop. Come on! You can curl up now!
Cibon: ARGS!
Announcer: This was the last fight of brigant pride, for today. Hopefully tomorrow we will have the opportunity to marvel at our model prisoners again!
Announcer: That was the last traitor fight for today! Now they can go back to their cells where they belong.
Soko: KILL !!!! 1
Note: These were just Soko's thoughts.
Announcer: The Zinkar butchers have lost. What a shame! Will they ever reach their archenemy like this?
Announcer: The Repsbrot troop was beaten. Well, people like you are eaten here for breakfast!
Cibon: ... Ouch! And I'm not saying that because of any wounds!
Announcer: Our model prisoners were beaten! So how does something go? How should we be proud of such a group, please?
Announcer: Unfortunately that was nothing! The traitors were beaten! Yes, we like to see something like that!

Saion: Hmpf! We'll win our tournament place back, just you wait!
Jorn: I see many months of cruel battles coming on me. Someone get me out of here, please!
Saion: Jorn, will you please stop complaining all the time?
Saion: Gurim and I survive the whole thing without complaining! So get yourself together!
Jorn: We all know by now that you like to be beaten up, and that Gurim never complains as well!
Jorn: Nobody is forcing us to do all these fights, have you ever thought of it?
Jorn: Damn, by now I would even prefer to work regularly in the mine instead of performing in the tournament again!
Saion: I am doing my best here to create a good reputation for us here and to move us forward!
Saion: And everything you do is gripe, gripe, gripe! You should be grateful to me for pulling you along at all!
Jorn: GRATEFUL ?! It is YOUR fault that we ended up here in the first place! Just because you absolutely wanted your fight back then!
Jorn: And even here fighting is the only thing you can think of!
Saion: I've told you several times! This life is in our blood! We, with the last name Zinkar, never lose out!
Saion: But what am I wondering at all. Of course you don't understand that! You are the BLACK SHEEP of the three of us!
Jorn: Right! I am the black sheep!
Jorn: Right! I am the black sheep! LUCKILY!
Jorn: Otherwise I would have this
Jorn: Otherwise I would have this IDIOT BLOOD in me that everyone
Jorn: Otherwise I would have this IDIOT BLOOD in me, which TAKES ALL MIND and one for me
Jorn: Otherwise I would have this IDIOT BLOOD in me that TAKES ALL MIND and gives me a THICK SKULL!
Saion: WHAT ARE YOU SAYING ?! COME BACK IMMEDIATELY!
Cibon: W ... what was that now ...
Soko: Gurim ... What was Jorn talking about?
Gurim: ... It's been a little while since they had an argument ...
Gurim: Jorn ... is really just a half brother of us ... Is a complicated subject ... < It's complicated...
Gurim: In any case, Saion doesn't manage to overlook this thing ...
Gurim: Excuse me, but I should make sure the two are right ...
Soko: ... It seems there is something more behind all the arguments ...
Kento: It's not that we have to play psychiatrists here. It is their business and we should not interfere.

Felcis: So my friend, we won, you know what that means? Bring the clunker. < Hand it over.
Robin: Yes, yes. Alright. You were lucky this time. You can have your stone.
Robin: The next time we meet in the tournament, it won't be that easy for you!
---
Pauamainer Member: That was a top performance from you today! We haven't had such good opponents in a long time!
Pauamainer Member: Have a look at our base if you already belong to the Pauamainer underground brotherhood! We might have something for you.

<# ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?!
Insane Girl: Ah! There you are again! What was going on?
Insane Girl: Well, where did I stop ... Hmm ... Oh yeah!
Insane Girl: I feel like accompanying you in the future. It's okay, isn't it?
Kento: Uhhhm ... well ...
Cibon: buddy, RACE!
Cibon: ARE YOU MADNESS ?! Do you want us all to get on our nerves?
Kento: The ... The question came so suddenly and unexpectedly! I wasn't prepared for it ...
Blond girl: Oh, hello! What are you doing here Somehow everything is so dark and dark here, isn't it?
Cibon: No matter how gloomy and dark it may be here, the presence of your beauty alone makes any desolation go away!
Blond girl: wow! How long has it been since I got such a great compliment!
Blond girl: the people here are all so grumpy and in a bad mood, but you're totally different! Great!
Blond girl: I thought my life had only been going downhill since I landed here.
Blond girl: And only because of a little theft! < And all because
Insane Girl: I just wanted to help two other people who were totally desperate.
Insane Girl: completely stupid! And now I have to work here in this terrible mine! It is exhausting!
Cibon: J ... Yes ... Really hard times here ...
Insane Girl: Yes! Exactly! It's great to have someone you can tell everything about, really! Knew what's going on here
It's great to have someone you can tell everything about, really! Did you know what happened to me here yesterday? I sat on

Cibon: buddy! Let's get out of here!
Kento: ... insane. That you literally run away from a woman. What else I can experience.
Cibon: THERE ARE YOU WONDERFUL !? This brat would have cut my last nerves within the next 4 minutes!
Kento: Well, you have to admit. It was quite "entertaining".
Cibon: ... I want to have missed that ...



-= 275 =-
Prisoner: We are staring with particular interest at the wall that you are currently able to cover. Get out of here.

...

Robin: We'll see you in the tournament then, haha!

Robin: Now you have your clunker again, I hope you are satisfied! But just wait! You rich bags will experience your downfall sooner or later!
Felcis: Ignore it. Simply ignore...

Prisoner: We give it to the poor because they really need it, oh yes we do!

Prisoner: We steal from the rich to make them less rich, oh yes we do!

Saion: You again. We'll see each other again in the tournament, just wait!
Soko: What's going on between you? You should talk about your problems instead of ...
Saion: Our problems? What is it that interests you? Take care of your own stuff!
Kento: Come on Soko, better leave it ...
Saion: Pah! The fact that you hit again means nothing! I demand revenge!
Jorn: Rule number one of the Zinkar brothers: We never learn our lesson!
Saion: Jorn, you kindly keep your cheeky mouth!
Saion: Ha! The Zinkar butchers are progressing, it seems. You will be surprised who slaughters whom!
Jorn: Your name is on the agenda!
Saion: Shut up, Jorn!
Saion: Place \ v [1886] are you already now? Not long now and our fight is imminent! Oh yeah!
Jorn: Oh joy.
Saion: Do you see? Even this stubborn redhead from brother is looking forward to this fight!
Jorn: Stubborn brother? Someone must have stuck a mirror to me somewhere.
Saion: What does that mean again ?!
Saion: Oh hello! There are the "Zinkar butchers"! Pretty self-confident when choosing a name, I just say!
Jorn: I already feel like fresh meat. < to be sliced
Saion: Quiet, Jorn! You always with your pessimistic manner.
Saion: Ha! And? What rank do you have now? We are all waiting impatiently for your challenge!
Jorn: Are we doing this?
Saion: We'll prove we can take on brigand order soldiers!
Jorn: You can just attack a couple of guards if you want to prove it.
Saion: Be quiet, Jorn!

Jorn: ... please leave me in peace, yes?
Jorn: I hope you had fun. You can try to fight these Pauamainers. They are really violent.
Jorn: I have to know, as often as Saion has taken on us ... And her boss is beyond our borders anyway ...
Saion: This is so typical of you again! Just howling and whining!
Jorn: After half a dozen defeats against this guy, I have every reason to do so!
Jorn: It looks like it will soon be a "slaughter festival". And I thought that ambition would only have this blue-haired mischief from brother.
Jorn: Well, wonderful, you are getting closer and closer to our place. You really mean it, don't you?
Cibon: Come on, it's just a tournament fight. And your brother didn't want it any other way.
Jorn: Yes, but I'm being dragged into this mess. Nobody asks me!
Soko: Believe me, on our side it's not necessarily that different.
Cibon: How, where, what? You never really complained, Soko!
Soko: So what? That doesn't mean that I like the stuff.
Jorn: Hey, I think we understand each other then.
Jorn: Come on, Soko, we're making a pact! We both will just go on strike and do nothing during the fight!
Soko: Sounds interesting.
Cibon: Now don't get stupid thoughts!
Jorn: Zinkar Butcher ... Very great name choice. Now I can't sleep peacefully during the night.
Saion: You're such a scaredy bunny! What does a name mean? You can see how far we've come!
Jorn: What? Fear is such a wonderful thing. It keeps you from doing stupid things.
Jorn: And some people here could really use a little more fear ...
Jorn: You really don't have to hurry with this tournament story.
Jorn: I'm really happy if my brother can't find an opponent to fight for a day ...
Soko: May I ask why you are doing everything your brother imposes on you?
Soko: You don't seem to agree very often ...
Jorn: Well ... um ... we're brothers?
Jorn: It's not that I know people I could go to when I leave my brothers.
Jorn: Besides, you can't imagine what kind of theater Saion would do in this case ...
Saion: What are you talking about over there?
Jorn: We are currently discussing whether your actions are due to a lack of intelligence or a mental disorder.
Saion: What the ... I act exactly as we have to act as a gang of thieves!
Jorn: Yes, you could really discuss the topic for a long time.

Gurim: ...
Gurim: Congratulations on your victory.
Cibon: Thank you, you fought well too.
Gurim: We'll see you in the tournament ...
Cibon: I'm curious to see if your fighting style has improved with this strange weapon.
Kento: Speaking of weird weapons. Are you still struggling with this filled pouch, Jorn?
Jorn: The one? No way! We wouldn't have enough items to fill it with a solid weight.
Kento: What are you fighting with?
Jorn: Well ... you'll see ...
Gurim: Hello ...
Soko: You are really a welcome change compared to your talkative brothers.
Gurim: D ... thank you ...
