# Velsarbor English
For now, parsed map files are not included, but may be in the future.
Images can be found along with patched map files in the `Releases` section.

# Resources
Uses the [final version of Velsarbor](https://www.multimediaxis.de/threads/137420-RM2K-Velsarbor-Die-letzte-Version) that is patched by TheDude.

# Context
AFAIK, the people who previously worked on translations never published their progress, and it seems like they haven't worked on it since.

Why am I doing this? Because Velsarbor looks exciting! Unfortunately, I can't understand German, and if I could, I wouldn't be doing this. So if I'm going to be putting everything into Google Translate to understand what's going on, I may as well go one step further and make whatever I've got public.

# Pronunciations
- Cibon: Pronounced with a hard C, so basically "Key-bon". The stress is on the first syllable.
- Zojeno: The J here is pronounced as a Y, so like "Zoyeno". (And for that matter, all J's are pronounced as Y's, because German.)
