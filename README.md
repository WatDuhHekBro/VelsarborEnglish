*Uses the final version of Velsarbor that is patched by TheDude.*
For now, parsed map files are not included, but may be in the future.

# Context
AFAIK, the people who previously worked on translations never published their progress, and it seems like they haven't worked on it since.

Why am I doing this? Because Velsarbor looks exciting! Unfortunately, I can't understand German, and if I could, I wouldn't be doing this. So if I'm going to be putting everything into Google Translate to understand what's going on, I may as well go one step further and make whatever I've got public.
