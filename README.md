# Velsarbor English
For now, parsed map files are not included, but may be in the future.
Images can be found along with patched map files in the `Releases` section.

# Resources
Uses the [final version of Velsarbor](https://www.multimediaxis.de/threads/137420-RM2K-Velsarbor-Die-letzte-Version) that is patched by TheDude.

# Context
AFAIK, the people who previously worked on translations never published their progress, and it seems like they haven't worked on it since.

Why am I doing this? Because Velsarbor looks exciting! Unfortunately, I can't understand German, and if I could, I wouldn't be doing this. So if I'm going to be putting everything into Google Translate to understand what's going on, I may as well go one step further and make whatever I've got public.

# Controls
*Useful for controller usage.*
There are only three true controls for the game. Movement, Select, and Back. In the game, these'll be referred to as `the arrow keys`, `Enter`, and `Esc` respectively.
- Movement is controlled by the `arrow keys` and is self-explanatory.
- "Select" is the key used to select a menu option as well as to run/walk when you hold the key. This key is `Z` as well as `Enter`.
- "Back" is the key used to cancel a menu option as well as to open/close the menu. This key is `X` as well as `Esc`.

These buttons below still do unique things, but are mostly for customization.
- `F4`: This toggles whether or not you play in fullscreen.
- `F5`: This toggles whether the game upscales by a factor of 2 or keeps the original ratio.
- `F12`: This brings you back to the title screen **regardless of whether or not you saved or where you are**.

# Pronunciations
- Cibon: Pronounced with a hard C, so basically "Key-bon". The stress is on the first syllable.
- All J's are pronounced as Y's, because German.

# Double-Checking
I'm not sure if it's feasible to double check every single line of the dialogue in-game to account for context. Revise when necessary.

# Dev Section Below
If you want to develop a workspace, use my [RPGMaker2kPatcher](https://github.com/WatDuhHekBro/RPGMaker2kPatcher) and then compile the JSON data files yourself. The work is all in `patch/`, so those will compile the patched binary files for use with the game.
