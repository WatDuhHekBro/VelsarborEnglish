# Installation
1. Download the [final version of Velsarbor](https://www.multimediaxis.de/threads/137420-RM2K-Velsarbor-Die-letzte-Version). Scroll down to the `Download` section and click `Velsarbor - Die letzte, unvollst√§ndige Version (Patched by TheDude)`. Do not download the original version.
2. Download an [unofficial German RTP](http://rpg2000.4players.de/index.php?inhalt=rpgmaker). Look for where it says `Runtimepackage 1.0 (12.5 MB)`, which should be the first section at the top-right. The file you download should be titled `RTPE.exe`.
3. Download the latest release patch in [this repository's releases](https://github.com/WatDuhHekBro/VelsarborEnglish/releases). Avoid the pre-releases unless you know what you're doing. Once you download the patch, open up the zip file and drag its contents into the working directory of wherever you put Velsarbor, and it should replace all the files.
4. If you get the error `DirectDraw Error(DDERR_UNSUPPORTED)` when starting the game, then set `RPG_RT.exe` to Windows 7 compatibility mode.
5. If you open up the game and the font looks unusually thick, you can download a [font patch](https://www.moddb.com/downloads/rpg-maker-2000-font-patch) to fix the font.

# Controls
*Useful for controller usage.*
There are only three true controls for the game. Movement, Select, and Back. In the game, these'll be referred to as `the arrow keys`, `Enter`, and `Esc` respectively.
- Movement is controlled by the `arrow keys` and is self-explanatory.
- "Select" is the key used to select a menu option as well as to run/walk when you hold the key. This key is `Z` as well as `Enter`.
- "Back" is the key used to cancel a menu option as well as to open/close the menu. This key is `X` as well as `Esc`.

These buttons below still do unique things, but are mostly for customization.
- `F4`: This toggles whether or not you play in fullscreen.
- `F5`: This toggles whether the game upscales by a factor of 2 or keeps the original ratio. 320x240 and 640x480 are the available resolutions.
- `F12`: This brings you back to the title screen **regardless of whether or not you saved or where you are**.

# Contributing
It'll probably be a while until I proofread everything and check for line endings (if I even get to that). So therefore, please let me know if there are any grammatical/spelling errors or line endings that feel awkward. Look for an existing issue about these mistakes. Only open up an issue on this repository if there isn't an issue. I recommend naming that issue `Mistakes Megathread <#>`.

# The List of Gotchas
There are several pieces of information about the game which is nowhere to be found inside the actual game itself, making it annoying to not know about. Here's a list of all these points so you don't have to go through that same headache:
- If you use magic lens to analyse a boss, you'll just get a bunch of question marks because lo and behold, you actually have a wait a couple of turns first.
- "Great <element>" spells are improved versions of its base spell, still single-target. The reason these have a `3` in their appearance is because you need to have 3 SP in order to cast these. These spells don't consume said SP though.
